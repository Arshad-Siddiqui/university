# Linked Lists

- More flexible and dont store data contiguously
- Great as they have dynamic memory allocation. Adding/removing elements is very flexible.
- Great for situations where number of elements change frequently

## Structure
![Linked list diagram](image-7.png)

They're made up of nodes which contain data and a pointer to the next node.

![Multiple nodes](image-8.png)

List ends when the pointer points to null

## Linked list operations

Insertion: Inserting anywhere is easy as you don't need to shift everything around.

Deletion: Deletion is simple by just changing pointers but requires traversing the list to find the node you wish to delete.

Traversal: Requires hopping from node to node.

Overall: More flexible but less fast.

## Singly linked lists

![Singly linked list](image-9.png)

They make it easy to go forward but tricky to go back. Only 1 pointer going forward.

## Doubly linked lists

Pointers point both ways making it a little easier to navigate forwards and backwards

![Doubly linked list](image-10.png)

More complex to manage and use up more memory

## Circularly linked list

Can be singularly or doubly linked but the end pointer goes back to the beginning

![Circularly linked list](image-11.png)

## Advantages to linked lists
- Dynamic size.
- Efficient insertions/deletions. No need to shift everything.
- Flexibility. No contiguous memory required

## Diadvantages
- Can't index and we have to traverse the linked list.
- Requires more memory as you're holding a pointer per node or maybe 2
- Can get quite complex to code especially doubly and circularly.

# 4.5.2 Linked list integration

2 ways to implement lists. Dynamic arrays and linked lists.

Regular arrays: store data contiguously and are fixed size. They let you quickly get data from them because of that contiguousness. Bit of math involving adding the index to the memory address of that first element.

---

Regular arrays can be used to implement lists. We keep an internal array and keep track of the reference to the tail. Whenever adding an element we plop it into the reference of the tail and update the tail to the new position.

Whenever the tail tries to access an element outside of that internal array you get an error as you're trying to access a pointer that doesn't exist.

This means that our list is capped off at the size of the array. A rather simple and problemed solution is to just declare a very large internal array. The problem with this is that it is a memory hog. Especially if you don't get close to filling up that giant array.

Dynamic array (different to linked lists) have a leg up over arrays as they only use up the space required and not much more. When that internal array gets filled up, we typically create a whole new array double the original size and copy over all the elements.

That keeps going on and saves us from just allocating a lot of memory straight away.

## Problem

If we take out an element we have to shuffle down all the elements afterwards and then update the pointer at the end of the list.

This means removing the last element is very efficient as we're just taking out the element and moving that pointer.

Removing that first element creates the worst possible scenario where everything shuffles down. Same with insertion at the beginning where we have to shuffle all the elements to the right to make space.

## Solution/linked lists

Elements in list are not stored contiguously. They are made up of nodes that contain a piece of data and a reference to the next element in the list.

To navigate this list we have to go through the preceding elements. Navigatin this list is therefore quite resource intensive.

![Linked list diagram](image-12.png)

Last element stores null/None as pointer. We need to store pointers to front and end of the list.

As we are storing the reference to each node we are using up more memory.

## List functions

Append: We stick another node to end of list. This is done by changing that final None pointer to a pointer to the next node.

Removing the first element is very efficient. We just update the head pointer to the second element. Adding an element to the beginning is efficient as well as we just have our new node point to the head node and update the head pointer to point to that new first node.

## Problem

Removing the last element is less efficient using linked lists however. We have to navigate down the whole list to find that last element making sure to keep track of the second last element as we need to update that with a None pointer and have the tail pointer refernce that.

> Inefficiency comes from accessing penultimate element from the list.

We can use a doubly linked list to help solve this problem at the expense of higher memory usage. This lets us go forwards and backwards.

This is because the tail now has a reference to the predecessor and we can just start from the back. Only takes 3 steps.

## Comparison

![Comparison of dynamic arrays adn linked lists](image-13.png)

### Access

In dynamic arrays it is more efficient to access elements as we can add the index to the memory address to get whatever element we need. This is fixed in terms of resource use.

Linked lists are less efficient as to access an element further down you need to first navigate the list and in the worst case you're looking at O(n) to get that last element.

However they are decent for accessing that first and last element.

### Search

Both equal at O(n). Switching to a linked list holds no benefit when your primary use for that data structure is search. This is because you will have to navigate through each one in the worst case to find your element(unless that array is sorted then you can binary search)

### Insertion

Dynamic array in general is O(1) however when that array fills up you get an O(n) problem.

With linked list you typically use it to insert/delete from the front and insert from the back O(1). If you were to use that linked list inappropriately however and insert in the middle (near) the end you do get O(n).

Implementation in [python](/algorithms/week4/python_/linkedadt.py)

# 4.5.3 Reading

Python list class is very efficiently designed but there are a few disadvantages.

1. The dynamic array is probably larger than the elements it holdsl

2. For real time systems amortized bounds may be unacceptable.

3. Insertions and deletions at interior positions are more expensive.

> Amortized meaning: So you know how most operations with a list are O(1). Well that copying over step is O(n). When calculating the average cost per operation we can amortize (spread the cost) of that big inconsistent step (copying the array) over many cheaper operations. Including amortized cost gives us a more realistic estimate of typical performance.

## Linked lists

They avoid the 3 disadvantages stated above but they have their own weaknesses.

For instance you can't access an index so easily and just by looking at a node we can't really know which position it sits.

## Singly linked lists

Where the nodes only have 1 reference and that's just to the next node. You can't traverse backwards as there is no reference to the previous node.

![Example of singly linked list](/algorithms/week4/Screenshot%202025-06-02%20at%2018.10.23.png)

> Note msp is just an example of a possible element

next points to the next node or None if there are no more nodes.

First and last nodes are often known as the head and tail. We can tell which one is the last node as it points to None.

Going from first node to last node is known as **traversing** the list. Traversing can also be referred to **pointer hopping** or **link hopping**.

### Linked list instance

Another class keeps track of these nodes. Minimally just the head node but it can be useful to track the length and tail node.

Keeping track of the length from thta linked list class is useful as the alternative to finding it is traversing the whole list while keeping a count which is O(n).

Keeping the tail node is useful as finding it otherwise would be O(n) until you find the node that points to None.

### Inserting nodes at the heda of singly

Inserting a node at the head is easy as we don't have to shift all elements down like in a traditional list.

#### Pseudo (my version/interpretation)
```
# inside linked_list class
function add_node_to_head(value):
    # create a new node and set element to the value
    new_node = Node(value)
    
    new_node.next = self.head
    self.head = new_node
    self.size += 1
```

### Inserting nodes at the head of singly

Also quite easy if we keep track of that tail node in our list class.

#### Pseudo
```
# Inside of linked_list class
def insert_element_at_tail(value)
    new_node = Node(value)
    new_node.next = None
    self.tail.next = new_node
    self.tail = new_node
    self.size += 1
```

### Removing element from head of singly

Pretty much just the reverse of inserting nodes at the head

#### Pseudo

```
# Inside of linked_list class

def remove_head_node():
    if self.head = None:
        raise error "list is empty"
    new_head = self.head.next()
    self.head = new_head
    self.size -= 1
```

### Removing last element in singly

HAHAHAHA don't even try. That's not why you implement a singly. Wrong tool for wrong job.

Even if you record the tail you still need to modify that second last node's pointer to None and the only way to get there on a single is to just navigate the whole list which is O(n).

Now you might be thinking, let's just record the second last element in the linked_list class as well. The problem with that is it is only useful for one deletion before you need to navigate the whole list to grab that second last node again.

### Singly for representing stacks

[Example](/algorithms/week4/python_/linked_stack.py)

Singlies are really good at representing a stack as you can efficiently make insertions and deletions at the head.

For doing so in python it is useful to make a Node class and store that privately within the LinkedList class. The Node class is part of the implementation and should be kept private as the user shouldn't have to deal with all that.

Each step is O(1) and pretty much always runs at worst case scenario

### Singly for representing queues

[Example](/algorithms/week4/python_/linked_queue.py)

O(1) worst case for all operations.

Need to maintain a head and a tail since we need to keep track of where elements are being popped off and where they are queuing up.

Pretty natural to line up front of list with head and back of list with tail

Important to remember when we dequeue something from the front and it was the last node, we should set both the head and the **tail** to None. Forgetting to do so will induce bugs when we start adding elements to it again.

## Circularly Linked Lists

Great for when the data shouldn't particularly have a beginning/end. Even though there is no beginning/end it is important to set a current node so we can move off of it. Then do..

```
self.current = self.current.next
```

and use that to advance thorugh the list.

### Round Robin Scheduler

Used to allocate CPU times to different applications

![round robin example](/algorithms/week4/Screenshot%202025-06-02%20at%2021.36.35.png)

1. Dequeue an element
2. Do our process or whatever we wanted with it.
3. Enqueue it back.

However more important to just keep track of a boundary that advances across the queue. This is better as it stops us having to de-allocate and re-allocate memory.

New steps would be

1. Service front of queue
2. Rotate

In our CircularQueue class we can just keep a reference of the tail as its pointer references the head. It is also useful to keep track of size so we know how to navigate the whole length.

It has an enqueue method that places an element between the current head and tail.

We also give it a rotate method that allows us to efficiently advance through the queue.

[Example](/algorithms/week4/python_/circular_queue.py)

## 7.3 Doubly linked lists

Keep a new instance variable 'prev'

Need a header node at front of list and trailer node at back of list. These are called sentinel/guard nodes and don't store any elements.

When creating a new doubly linked list the header has a next that points to the trailer and the trailer has a prev that points to the header. The remaining attributes should be set to None in python as at this point these attributes are irrelevant

When the linked list is non-empy the next on the header should point to the first element wielding node and the prev of the trailer should point to the penultimate node.

### Advantages of using sentinels

Keeps the header and trailer consistent.

The header and trailer being untouched ensures everything is between them so when we do a deletion/insertion we can assure that it is sandwiched between 2 nodes.

In a lot of your previous interpretations of these ADTs you had to always consider all the different cases and that got complex fast.
