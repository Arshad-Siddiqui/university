# Trees!

Some dude said thinking nonlinearly is where breakthroughs happen. This is true with data structures as Trees have enabled us some very efficient algorithms that wouldn't be possible on an array for instance.

They also naturally represent data for certain structures. Such as how a website is organised down to its pages, GUIs, databases and file systems.

- They store data **hierarchically** instead of linearly.
- Language used to describe node relationships are **parent/child** and **descendent/ancestor**.
- Aside from the **root** node, all nodes have parents and 0 or more children.
- Trees can be empty where they have no nodes.
- Nodes that have the same parent node are **siblings**
- **Internal** nodes have children and **external** nodes do not.
- Extenal nodes are sometimes called **leaves**.
- Subtrees are located within trees. To describe a subtree you'd describe it's root. 'Subtree rooted at directory A'
- **Edges** of a tree are the relationship between a parent and child. Contains 2 nodes that are directly related.
- **Paths** are made of edges. Think of edges like roads and paths like the collection of roads that make routes.

##Â Ordered Trees
A tree is ordered if the children of the nodes are in a particular order.

Thi is normally visualised by placing the elements left to right.

    |root|
    /   \
   /     \
|child1| |child2|

## Tree abstract data type

Python let's you make your own tree data type.

## Binary Tree
- Ordered tree where each parent has no more than 2 children.
- Children are sorted left and right. A left child has precedence over a right child.
- If these children are subtrees then we call them left and right subtree of that node.
- In proper binary trees, each node only has 0 or 2 children. A tree where a node has 1 element is called an improper tree.

### Python ADT

Because trees are abstract data types in python we have to define functions for it. With a binary tree we have a few more valid options.

T -> Tree class
t is instance

t.left -> gives the left child
t.right -> gives the right child,
t.sibling -> gives the sibling node or None if non-existant.

We can see that as we add levels to binary tree the max number of nodes grows exponentially. Could potentially do some cool maths with it.
