# Trees!

Store data hierarchically instead of linearly. Language used to describe node relationships are parent/child and descendent/ancestor. Aside from the **root** node, all nodes have parents and 0 or more children.

- Trees can be empty where they have no nodes.
- Nodes that have the same parent node are **siblings**
- **Internal** nodes have children and **external** nodes do not.
- Extenal nodes are sometimes called **leaves**.
- Subtrees are located within trees. To describe a subtree you'd describe it's root. 'Subtree rooted at directory A'
- **Edges** of a tree are the relationship between a parent and child. Contains 2 nodes that are directly related.
- **Paths** are made of edges. Think of edges like roads and paths like the collection of roads that make routes.
- **height** of a node is the number of edges between the route and it. Or how many edges in the path from that element to the route.

## Ordered Trees
A tree is ordered if the children of the nodes are in a particular order.

Thi is normally visualised by placing the elements left to right.

    |root|
    /   \
   /     \
|child1| |child2|

## Tree abstract data type

Python let's you make your own tree data type.

## Binary Tree
- Ordered tree where each parent has no more than 2 children.
- Children are sorted left and right. A left child has precedence over a right child.
- If these children are subtrees then we call them left and right subtree of that node.
- In proper binary trees, each node only has 0 or 2 children. A tree where a node has 1 element is called an improper tree.

### Python ADT

Because trees are abstract data types in python we have to define functions for it. With a binary tree we have a few more valid options.

T -> Tree class
t is instance

t.left -> gives the left child
t.right -> gives the right child,
t.sibling -> gives the sibling node or None if non-existant.

We can see that as we add levels to binary tree the max number of nodes grows exponentially. Could potentially do some cool maths with it.

## Reading 8.3: Implementing Trees

### Linked structure for Binary Tree

- This node references the element stored as well as children and parent.
- If it has no parent (it is the root) then it stores None at the parent field.
- If a left or right child is missing then it stores None on them too.

- The actual tree class (not node) stores a reference to the root and also a size variable that represents the number of nodes attached.

### Doing an implementation

Overall the book, a chapter back, implemented a regular Tree class. They later subclassed out a binary tree ADT in this section. They basically built on top of it. The class was called LinkedBinaryTree that internally holds a Tree class instance.

Their implementation had a hidden _Node class. They then used a public Position class to present the node.

### Array based implementation
