# Sets

- Unordered collection of unique items.
- Means they are not indexable.
- Use curly braces
- Adding an already existing element does nothing.
- Removing an element that doesn't exist raises a key error. If you want to avoid an error you can use **discard** instead of **remove** method
- When looping through it is done sorta randomly as the elements aren't in any order.
- Pop removes a random element as well.

```py
fruits = {'apple', 'banana'}
print(fruits)
# ('apple', 'banana')

fruits.add('chocolate')
print(fruits)
# ('apple', 'banana', 'chocolate')
fruits.add('chocolate')
print(fruits)
# ('apple', 'banana', 'chocolate')

fruits.remove("fish")
# > KeyError 'fish'
fruits.discard("fish")
# Nothing happened.
fruits.remove("chocolate")
print(fruits)
# ('apple', 'banana')

fruits.pop()
# removes and returns random element
```

## Use cases of sets

Can be used to remove duplicates from list/string. Can create a list of unique elements.

.union lets you combine 2 sets without any duplicates. | is a shorthand for union as well.

`set1 | set2` returns another set with all the values.

.insersection returns a set with common colours between 2 sets.

`set1.intersection(set2)`

.difference returns a set with only the elements that aren't on both sets.

## Speed

Sets are really good for searches as they use hash tables. They do use more memory tho.
