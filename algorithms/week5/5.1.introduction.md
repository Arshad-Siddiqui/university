### Analysing recursive functions

#### Computing factorials

5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

Pretty easy to turn this into an algorithm using recursion

```py
def factorialise(value):
  if value == 0
    return 1
  return value * factorialise(value - 1)
```
##### Code analysis

- We call the function from within the function but with a different argument.
- There's that guard clause to stop us calling the function forever.

##### Algorithm analysis

- There are n + 1 activations of our function. (n + 1 because we're calling it from n -> 0)
- Ignoring constants we're left with **O(n)**.

#### Drawing an English Ruler

We could represent the lines on a ruler using '-' where the more significant values are longer '---' and they get shorter at the mid points and the mid points of those mid points.
