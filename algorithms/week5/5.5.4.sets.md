# Sets

Designed to store stuff without a particular order but ensuring no duplicates. This is all done efficiently under the hood.

Sorta reminds you of keys for a dict which are also unique.

**Multisets** which are also known as bags are like sets except they allow duplicates.

**Multimaps** are like maps except the same same key can be mapped to multiple values. (I wonder how that works?)

## Set ADT

Python has built in structures frozenset and set where frozenset is immutable. The implementation uses hash tables.
