# Spanning Trees

A sub graph of an undirected graph that contains the minimum amount of edges to connect up all the vertices. They are therefor connected and contain no cycles.

Spanning trees are useful for reducing redundancy. For example with designing networks.

A minimum spanning tree is the spanning tree with the smallest possible total weight for a given set of vertices and edges.

## Greedy algorithms 

When an algorithm is said to be greedy it focuses on finding a solution every step and iterating on that in hopes to finding the best solution. It does this without considering the whole scope of the problem.

The two algorithms used for finding MSTs are both greedy. For the examples we're assuming simple graphs so no self-loops and no double edges.

If the weights of a graph are distinct then there is only 1 minimimum spanning tree.

## Prim Jarnik Algorithm

Similar to Dijkstra's where we start with a singular vertex and incrementally add new ones to a 'cloud'. Because we're always adding an element with the smallest possible edge weight, we're adding a valid edge to the MST.

It uses a priority queue for the weights of each vertex added.

### Analysing Prim Jarnik

Similar to Dijkstra's where it is O((m + n)log(n)).

## Kruskal's algorithm

Instead of just building off one vertex we form a forrest of clusters that eventually fuse together to form a MST.
