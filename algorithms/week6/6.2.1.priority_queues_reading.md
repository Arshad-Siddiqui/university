# Reading: Priority Queues

Like a regular queue where its FIFO but a lot more messy?

When adding an element to the priority queue, a priority is also given by providing an associated key.

The element with the lowest key is the next to be removed from the priority queue.

In python any object can be a key provided comparison can be done on it. It needs to support `<` so a natural order of the keys can be established.

In such cases where the minimum key is the same across multiple elements, an arbitrary one is chosen.

## Implementing with unsorted list

When using an unsorted list to implement your priority queue. Finding the minimum key involves a search which is O(n)

Most other operations not involving finding the minimum key are all O(1)

In cases where you constantly need the minimum key it's better off you use a sorted list.

## Implementing with sorted list

When adding you need to maintain order of the elements so worst case O(n)

Looking for the minimum is easy because it is sorted and the minimum key is right at the front.

In cases where you're adding a lot to the list continually you're best off using an unsorted list.
