# Heaps

Specialised binary trees used to implement priority queues efficiently. Can also be used for searches.

They are complete binary trees that satisfy heap property.

Max-Heap: Node's value is greater than children values. Priority queues have this version

Min-Heap: Node value is less than children's values. Sorting algorithms have this version.

Overall the above rules ensure that the max/min element is always at the root of the tree depending on what kind of heap you have.

## Heap properties

Always a complete binary tree where all levels are filled aside from potentially the last level. They are filled from left to right.

This means all levels are full aside from the bottom level which has the remaining elements lined up from the left.

Heap height is log n as it is a complete binary tree. O(log n)

Height of a tree is the number of edges from root to a leaf. (Don't count nodes as you'll always have 1 more to the height.)

## Heap Operations

Largest element is the root allowing O(1) access to it in a max heap. The inverse for a min heap. 

Insertion/deletions take O(log n) as the binary tree height doesn't increase at the same rate as the data set increases.

### Insertion

1. Element gets added to the bottom row and as left as possible

2. Bubble up the element to the right place. Restores heap property.

In this case 16 needs to move up the max heap as it is bigger than its parent 7. Bubbling up is just where the value swaps places.

So 6 swaps with 7, then 10, then 12 until it reaches the root in this case as 16 is larger than all of them.

## Deletion

Typically the root is to be deleted from a heap

1. Remove the root element by replacing it with the element right at the bottom right of the tree to maintain tree structure.

This generally violates the heap property.

3. Restore heap property. In a max heap you replace the temporary root with the greater child and in a min heap you replace the temporary root with the lesser child.

4. Keep swapping until the heap property is fully restored.
