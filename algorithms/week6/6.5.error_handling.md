# Error Handling

Instead of just having an error and your whole program crash it can be better to handle it yourself.

Great for web apps where your user can be weird and try some weird stuff.

```py
try:
  do some code that could break
except: 
  code has crashed so do this.

# When you have differnt types of errors you can do the below...

except ZeroDivisionError:
  print("you messed up homie. Divide by zero haram")

# Can reuse some code for when multiple errors need to give back same output.
except (SomeErrorOne, SomeErrorTwo):
  print("You hit one of the two above errors")

except ValueError:
  print("Wrong type of data buddy.")

# Can use 'else' which only executes if no error is reached.

else:
  print("Let's get some work done")

# Finally always executes

finally:
  print("this message will always print.")
```

## Raising custom errors

```py
# Can create your own type of error like this
class SomeCoolError(Exception):
  pass

# Can manually raise an error with raise keyword
raise SomeCoolError
# Raised error can then be try except

Need to document your raises

def somefunc(param1, param2):
  """Description of func
  args: ~
  raises:
    SomeCoolError
  
  """

```

Your job is usually just to raise errors and let the user handle them.
