# Reading: 12.4 Studying sorting through an Algorithmic lense

A lot of the algorithms seen are O(nlogn). This is because for sorting the main tool we have is comparison and we have a minimum of number of comparisons necessary to get a sorted list.

As this is the best case scenario for sorting algorithms we say Ω(nlogn)

Omega meaning at minimum we're doing nlogn number of comparisons and likely to do more.

## Trying to beat Ω(nlogn)

Basically when we're able to sort without using comparisons.

### Bucket Sort

When each element keyed and we're trying to get the keys in order we can employ **bucket sort** which is O(n).

Jist of it is we put elements into a bucket array into their correct place and put them back in the original array. This avoids comparisons.

### Stable Sort
