# 📚 Reading: 12.4 — Studying Sorting Through an Algorithmic Lens

## Why is Sorting Often **O(n log n)?**

Most common sorting algorithms are **comparison-based**, and comparison sorting has a **lower bound of Ω(n log n)** — meaning that **any** comparison-based sort must perform at least that many comparisons in the worst case.

* **Ω (Omega)** notation refers to a lower bound — i.e., the *minimum* amount of work an algorithm must do.
* This is a mathematical result from decision tree analysis for sorting.

---

## Can We Beat Ω(n log n)?

Only if we **don’t use comparisons**.

### 🪣 Bucket Sort

* Works when input is **already bucketable** — for example, numbers in a known range.
* Time complexity: **O(n + k)** where `k` is the number of buckets.
* Great for **uniformly distributed integers/floats**.
* Instead of comparing elements, you assign them to buckets based on their value and concatenate the results.

### 🔠 Radix Sort

* A **non-comparison sort** that handles integers or strings by processing digit-by-digit or character-by-character.
* Time complexity: **O(d(n + b))**, where:

  * `n` = number of elements
  * `d` = number of digits/characters per element
  * `b` = base (e.g., 10 for decimal)
* Often implemented using **bucket sort** internally for each digit/character.
* **Stable** and **linear** time when `d` and `b` are small.

---

## Stable Sorting

A sorting algorithm is **stable** if:

* Equal elements appear in the **same order** as they did in the input.

Useful when you're sorting records on multiple fields:

* E.g., sort by `last name`, then by `first name`.

| Algorithm      | Time Complexity (Worst) | Space Complexity | Stable? | Notes                                  |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |

## 🧠 Notes on Key Algorithms

### Insertion Sort

* Time: O(n²), but best case (almost sorted): **O(n + m)**, where `m` = number of inversions.
* Great for **small or mostly sorted** sequences.
* Very easy to implement.

### Heap Sort

* Time: **Always O(n log n)**.
* **In-place**, so it works well in **memory-limited systems**.
* **Not stable** due to frequent element swaps.
* Poor cache performance compared to Merge Sort.

### Quick Sort

* Average case: O(n log n), Worst case: O(n²)
* **Fastest in practice** for many data types, but:

  * **Not stable**
  * Performance depends on pivot strategy
* Often used in hybrid algorithms like **Timsort** (Python’s sort).

### Merge Sort

* Always O(n log n), **stable**, and recursive.
* Requires O(n) additional memory, so not in-place.
* Excellent for **external sorting** (e.g., large files).
* Good cache performance due to sequential access.

### Bucket & Radix Sort

* Radix: O(d(n + b)), Bucket: O(n + k)
* **Not comparison-based**, can beat Ω(n log n)
* Very efficient for:

  * Small integer keys
  * Character strings
  * Other discrete, fixed-range values
* Limited applicability, but unbeatable when suitable.

---

## Python's Built-in Sorting (`sorted()` / `.sort()`)

* Uses **Timsort**, a hybrid of **Merge Sort** and **Insertion Sort**.
* Time: **O(n log n)** worst-case, **stable**, and highly optimized.
* Allows a `key=` parameter for custom sorting logic.
* Efficient even for nearly-sorted or small datasets.

# 🧪 Exercise: Detecting Duplicates — Sorting vs Hashing

### 1. Sorting-Based Detection

```python
def detect_duplicates(data):
    data.sort()  # Assumes in-place sort like Timsort
    for i in range(1, len(data)):
        if data[i] == data[i-1]:
            return True
    return False
```

* Sorts first (O(n log n)), then checks for adjacent duplicates (O(n)).
* Total complexity: **O(n log n)**
* Works for any comparable data type.

### 2. Set-Based Detection (Hashing)

```python
def detect_duplicates(data):
    return len(set(data)) != len(data)
```

* Converts to a set (O(n)) and compares lengths.
* Total complexity: **O(n)** — very efficient!
* Assumes elements are **hashable** (can be keys in a dict).

---

### 3. Notes on Hash-Based Approach

* Uses a **hash table** under the hood.
* Insert/check time per element: O(1) on average
* Total time: O(n)
* More efficient than sorting, but:

  * Only works for **hashable** types
  * Not memory-optimal for very large data

---

## Summary

| Approach   | Time       | Pros                            | Cons                                |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Sorting    | O(n log n) | Works with all comparable types | Slower, destructive (in-place)      |
| Hash Table | O(n)       | Very fast, minimal code         | Requires hashable data, more memory |

> Rule of thumb: Use hashing when speed is key and elements are hashable. Use sorting if you also need ordering.
