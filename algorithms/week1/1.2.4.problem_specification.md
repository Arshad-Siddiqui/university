# The Problem Specification

Involves clearly defining the problem to be solved. It consists of allowed **inputs** and desired **outputs**.

## 4 factors deciding algorithm correctness

- Finiteness
- Correctness
- Unambiguity
- Feasibility

## 1 Finiteness

There should be an ending with a solution. An algorithm going on forever is bad.

### Insertion sort

Algorithm terminates as it reaches the last element. Each step gets closer to the sorted list. 

## 2 Unambiguity

Insertion sort lacks ambiguity

## 3 Sequence

Operations occur 1 at a time with no skipping or jumping.

There is a specific order.

With insertion sort the order of steps are important. Later steps require previous steps complete.

## 4 Feasibility

e.g. Would a method that takes years to sort 10 books be feasible?

In insertion sort the feasibility drops with more and more elements.

## Questions 

### Why is it important to consider the feasibility of an algorithm before using it in real-world scenarios?

My answer: It is important to look at the algorithms real world use and how it stacks up to needs.

For example an inefficient algorithm that exponentially gets longer with work load would be a poor solution where a large workload is the norm. For example sorting videos on a social media platform would take very long.

Additions from model answer: Need to consider practical time and resource limits.

### How does unambiguity affect the correctness of an algorithm

my answer: If there are steps which are ambiguous different people can interpret them differently and get different results. This comes from poorly describing a step.

Additions: Ambiguity also means that it is harder to test for correctness as there are vague steps you aren't sure how to scrutinise as they are poorly defined.

Unambiguity is very important as it reduces the chances of errors.

### In the context of a university timetabling problem, what does correctness mean, and how would you ensure that the timetable you create is correct?

A correct timetable ensures that there are no overlaps between classes for any particular student. It also takes into consideration that professors can't be double booked. It also does not cause clashes with lecture rooms where multiple classes can't take place at the same location.
