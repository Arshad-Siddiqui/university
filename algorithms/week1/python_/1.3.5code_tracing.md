# Code Tracing

Where programmers use pen and paper to track what each variable is doing throughout the program.

```
feet_input = input('Enter the number of feet:')
feet = int(feet_input)
inches_input = input('Enter the number of inches:')
inches = int(inches_input)
total_inches = (feet * 12 + inches)
number_meters = total_inches  * 0.0254
print('the distance is', number_meters, 'meters')
```

## Let's track!

feet_input - a string and whatever the user inputs = '2'

feet - integer value of string = 2

inches_input - a string of whatever the user inputs = '6'

inches - integer version of above string = 6

total_inches = 24 + 6 = 30
number_meters = 30 * 0.0254
