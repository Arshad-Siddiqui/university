# What is a program

Instructions that show a computer how to compute

- Input
- Output
- Math
- Conditionals
- Repetition

All languages allow these operations. A way to program is to break up a program into smaller and smaller subtasks until you can solve each subtask using just these tools.

## Expressions

Always equate to a value. A combination of operators, operands.

```
10 + 10
'hello' + 'world'
```

Expressions can exist on the right side of assignment.

left side of assignment must be a variable

`fred = 10 + 2`

### Operators and operands

Operators are + - / *

Operands are the values the operators are working on.

**2** + **2**

**pemdas/bidmas** applies to computer math

You can stack expressions together

`(10 + 12) - (3 * 4)`
