# The Problem Specification

Involves clearly defining the problem to be solved. It consists of allowed **inputs** and desired **outputs**.

## 4 factors deciding algorithm correctness

- Finiteness
- Correctness
- Unambiguity
- Feasibility

## Finiteness

There should be an ending with a solution. An algorithm going on forever is bad.

### Insertion sort

Algorithm terminates as it reaches the last element. Each step gets closer to the sorted list. 


## Unambiguity
