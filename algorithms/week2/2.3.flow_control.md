## 2.3.1 Boolean and Boolean Expressions

- In python the type is called **Bool**
- **True** and **False** (Capital first letter is important here)
- Comparison operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
- Beware of floating point errors with python. This can easily effect comparisons. Maths module has the solution.

```py
print(0.1 + 0.2 == 3)
# Output: False

print(0.1 + 0.2)
# Output: 0.30000000000000004

print(math.isclose(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3))
# Output: True
```
- **'not'**, **'and'**, **'or'** are operators.
- Can even compare strings.

'a' < 'b'

## challenge

not a and not b and c or not d

1. not has the highest precedence. So you have to look at (not a) (not b) (not d) first

2. and is second highest precenence

3. or has lowest precedence.

- Make sure to use brackets to make it more readable
