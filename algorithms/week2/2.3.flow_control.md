## 2.3.1 Boolean and Boolean Expressions

- In python its called Bool
- True and False (Capital first letter is important here)
- <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
- Beware of floating point errors with python. This can easily effect comparisons. Maths module has the solution.

math.isclose(a, b)

- 'not', 'and', 'or' are operators.

- Can compare strings

'a' < 'b'

challenge

not a and not b and c or not d

1. not has the highest precedence. So you have to look at (not a) (not b) (not d) first

2. and is second highest precenence

3. or has lowest precedence.

- Make sure to use brackets to make it more readable
