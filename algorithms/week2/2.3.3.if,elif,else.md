# Selection/ conditional statements

So far have only used sequencing. It is when the program is basic and just gets read top to bottom.

Conditional code only runs whether true or false. A bit more complex than sequential code.

## Examples

```py
if condition:
  # If condition above is true do this
elif condition:
  # Do this if the conditions before this one were all false and this one is true
else:
  # If all the conditions are false then do this one.
```
