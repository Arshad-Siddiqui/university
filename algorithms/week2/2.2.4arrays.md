# Arrays

To understand Arrays it's important to know about bits and bytes.

Bits: Smallest units of information.

Bytes: 8 bits

## Bytes

Each byte is given a unique memory address.

Programming languages use identifiers to keep track of memory addresses.

e.g. x -> 12

## Managing sequences

- Arrays are great as they store related values contiguously. (Next to each other without gaps)

- Array can hold each character in a string.

- In python each character requires 2 bytes as unicode.

- Cells: Contain each memory location in an array

- Indexed from 0

- To access any cell based on index it is important each cell be the same length in bytes.

Then you have the option to do (cell size * index) and adding that to the start address.

## Limitations of static arrays

Static arrays have a specified size at creation to allocate contiguous memory.

Tuples/Strings are immutable.

List class is dynamic and can be made larger.

## Lists

Under the hood there are static arrays that are built a little larger than is required. That way when new elements are added there was already that size given.

When that fills up a new array is created with extra cells that can be filled up and so forth.

The old Array is...
