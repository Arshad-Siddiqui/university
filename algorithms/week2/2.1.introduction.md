## 🧠 The Importance of Modelling

Many algorithmic problems have been solved before—but possibly in **different contexts or domains**, making them hard to find unless you know the **underlying abstract structure**.

> ✅ **Why abstraction matters:**
> It’s more useful to learn **general patterns** (like permutations, trees, and graphs) that appear across multiple real-world domains (e.g. scheduling, sorting, networks).

## 🔢 Abstract Data Types and Mathematical Models

### ➤ **Permutations**

* Represent all possible orderings of a set.
* `[1, 3, 5]` and `[5, 3, 1]` are **different permutations** of the same elements.

### ➤ **Subsets**

* Any group of elements selected from a larger set, **regardless of order**.
* `{1, 3, 5}` is a subset of `[1, 3, 5, 2, 7]` (so is `{3, 1, 5}`).
* Note: A Python **slice** is a **subsequence**, not a true subset, because it preserves order and contiguity:

```py
my_list = [14, 11, 9]
my_slice = my_list[0:2]
# Output: [14, 11]
```

### ➤ **Sets**

* Unordered collections of **distinct elements**.
* `{3, 1, 5}` is a set.
* Useful for checking membership, tagging systems, liked posts, etc.

## 🌲 Trees & 📉 Graphs

### ➤ **Trees**

* Hierarchical structure with one root node and children branching out.
* Used in: file systems, comment threads, decision trees.
* Properties:

  * **Root**: topmost node
  * **Leaf**: node with no children
  * **Subtree**: smaller tree within the larger one

### ➤ **Graphs**

* Consist of **vertices (nodes)** and **edges (connections)**.
* Used for: maps, social networks, transport systems.

  * In Facebook: users = vertices, friendships = edges
* Can be **directed or undirected**, **weighted or unweighted**.

---

## 🟰 Points and Polygons

### ➤ **Points**

* Represent **locations** in geometric space (e.g. latitude/longitude).
* Basic unit in spatial modelling.

### ➤ **Polygons**

* Formed from connecting multiple points to form a **closed shape**.
* Used for defining **regions** (e.g. a country’s borders on a map).

---

## 💬 Strings

* A string is a **sequence of characters**.
* Used in: text processing, search, natural language tasks.

## 🔁 Recursive Objects

Many of the structures above can be **defined recursively**:

> “Big things made of little versions of themselves.”

| Structure              | Recursive Insight                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tree**               | A tree is a node with 0+ subtrees                       |
| **Graph**              | Remove a vertex → smaller graph                         |
| **Subset/Permutation** | Remove an element and operate recursively               |
| **String**             | A string of length n = character + string of length n-1 |
| **Polygon**            | Can be divided into triangles (basic polygons)          |

### ✅ Base cases (smallest versions):

* Empty string: `""`
* Tree: single node
* Subset: empty set
* Permutation: one arrangement of 0 elements = empty list

## 📽️ 2.2.2 Video Summary – *What is a Data Structure?*

* A **data structure** is a way of **organizing and storing data** so it can be used efficiently.
* Common mistake: Developers get stuck using familiar structures (“hammer and nail” mentality).

> “Using the right data structure makes efficient algorithms possible.”

### 🆚 Data Structures vs Algorithms

| Aspect           | Data Structure                            | Algorithm                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Definition**   | How data is organized                     | Steps to solve a problem |
| **Example**      | List, tree, hash table                    | Sorting, searching       |
| **Relationship** | Algorithms operate **on** data structures | —                        |

## 📂 Data Structure Applications

| Structure | Real-world Use                           |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Set**   | Tags, user likes, recommendations        |
| **Tree**  | Filesystems, menus, comment threads      |
| **Graph** | Social networks, routes, link structures |

## 🔍 2.2.3 Reading – **Search Algorithms**

### ➤ Sequential (Linear) Search

* Works on **unsorted lists**
* Check each item until you find the target or reach the end
* **Time complexity**: **O(n)**

### ➤ Binary Search

* Works only on **sorted lists**
* Repeatedly divide the list in half

### 🧠 Binary Search Algorithm:

```py
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

* **Base condition**: search fails if `low > high`
* **Time complexity**: **O(log n)** — very efficient

📊 Example: Searching in a list of 1 billion elements → at most \~30 steps!

## 📈 Big-O Recap

| Algorithm          | Time Complexity  | Use When                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Linear Search**  | O(n)             | List is unsorted             |
| **Binary Search**  | O(log n)         | List is sorted               |
| **Insertion Sort** | O(n²) worst-case | Small or mostly sorted input |

## 📌 Final Notes

* Recursive models are powerful but need **base cases** to stop infinite breakdown.
* Modelling helps **abstract real-world problems** into known structures we can solve.
* Choosing the **right data structure** is key to **performance and scalability**.
