# Reading

## Boolean expression and conditional statements

Booleans allow branching where certain parts of the code run depending on condition. This is different to just sequencial where everything is ready linearly.

- Allows code to be broken down into understandable little sections where you can focus on getting each piece working. Let's you make more complex apps basically.
- Let's you incorporate user interaction as users can make choices on which way the code runs.
- Error handling typically uses conditionals.

## NOTES

There is some reading at the bottom but I feel like I have seen all that already.
