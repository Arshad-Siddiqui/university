## definite loops

When you know how many times you want to loop the program it is called a count controlled loop. or **definite loop**

for i in range(5):
  print(i)

runs the code over adn over again but swapping out i with the values on the right side of in.

### range

range(start, stop, step): -> range_object

- start is an optional parameter.
- stop is required and shows where to stop counting up. it isn't included.
- step shows how large the interval is. by default it is 1.

so...

```
range(5) -> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
range(3, 6) -> 3, 4, 5
range(3, 7, 3) -> 3, 6
```

it returns range object which is just used for iterating on.

## indefinite

- while statement

Down below is indefinite as it uses a while statement.
```
i = 0
while i < 5:
  print(i)
  i += 1
```

expected output:
0
1
2
3
4

When you don't know how long the loop goes then it is an indefinite/condition controlled loop.

If condition is true then the loop keys going.

If the condition is always true then you have a runtime error.

If condition is always false then it never runs. A bit like an if statement.

```
for i in range(5):
  print(i)
```

Lecture brozzer then goes over using a debugger and placing a red marker over where you want the app to pause and about step over/backwards. Also shows how you can keep track of certain things.

> I did kinda skip through the debugger section but if i have time i should come back!
