## Definite loops

When you know how many times you want to loop the program, it is called a count controlled loop or **definite loop**

```py
for i in range(5):
  print(i)
```

Runs the code over and over again but swapping out `i` with the values on the right side of in.

### range

`range(start, stop, step): -> range_object`

- start is an optional parameter.
- stop is required and shows where to stop counting up. it isn't included.
- step shows how large the interval is. by default it is 1.

so...

```py
range(5) -> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
range(3, 6) -> 3, 4, 5
range(3, 7, 3) -> 3, 6
```

It returns range object which is just used for iterating on.

## indefinite

- You use a **while** statement when you don't know how many loops you need. Tell the computer to just keep looping until this statement is true.

Down below is indefinite as it uses a while statement.

```py
i = 0
while i < 5:
  print(i)
  i += 1
```

expected output:

---

- When you don't know how long the loop goes then it is an indefinite/condition controlled loop.
- If condition is true then the loop keys going.
- If the condition is always true then you have a runtime error.
- If condition is always false then it never runs. A bit like an if statement.

## For loops

```
for i in range(5):
  print(i)
```
