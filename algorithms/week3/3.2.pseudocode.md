# Pseudocode

- Great way to plan.

## Needs to be

- **simple:** Make it readable to a non-programmer.

- **structured:** Structure it like you would a program

- **abstract:** Try and make it language agnostic

## Question: How does Pseudocode differ from actual programming code?

Firstly pseudocode won't run on a computer as it has been abstracted for human eyes. It follows a similar structure to programming language but uses spoken language.

It lets you focus on the underlying logic and steps while not having to focus on the technical implementation such as syntax etc.

It is like a blueprint for the actual program.

## Right level of abstraction

You don't want the pseudocode too vague so when it comes down to writing actual code you aren't sure of what is being asked. You also don't want it to be too technical and close to actual code because you might funnel the logic to only work in a particular language/technology. It will also take extra time to write it that explicitly where you might as well right the code down directly.
