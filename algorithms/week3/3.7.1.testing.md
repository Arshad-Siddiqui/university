# Testing

- Ensures reliable and efficient code.
- Unit tests and tests of entire systems.

- However we're just focusing on unit tests for functions.

## Test Driven Development
Where you write tests before you write code. Serves as a guide for development.

Code is then written to satisfy these tests and then rewritten as you add more tests.

Makes the code easy to maintain and modify.

Also all them tests means it is well documented.

Assert statement makes testing easy. If assert fails then you know the test is bad.

> Testing isn't just for finding errors. Can be used to build robust dependable code.

```
def factorial(n):
  assert n > 0, "n must be positive"
```

Assert statements raise **AssertionErrors**

## Limitations of assert statement.

- very simple and does not provide a comprehensive report.
- It also stops the execution of the program when a test fails.

## unit test

- python module which is a bit more robust.
- Is a built in module.
- Has a test runner that can run all tests in the program and provide a detailed report.
- Will be covered later.

## Can assert for pre and post conditions

```python
def factorial(n):
    assert n >= 0, "n must be non-negative"
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    output = 1
    for i in range(2, n+1)
        output *= i
    return output

assert factorial(0) == 1, “factorial(0) must return 1”
assert factorial(1) == 1
assert factorial(2) == 2
assert factorial(3) == 6
assert factorial(4) == 24
assert factorial(5) == 120
```

## Docstrings

- String that is the first statement in package/module/class/function. Is a special attribute to the object. so calling object.doc.

- For consistency we use """three double quotes"""

- Each line should end in a period. question mark? or exclamation point!

```
"""This is the form of a docstring.
It can be spread over several lines.
""" 
```

# functions/methods

- Should have a docstring unless really short, unnecessary or not externally visible.

The main use is making clear how others should use your function afterall.

- Docstring should be descriptive instead of imperative.

"""returns data to database"""

intead of

"""return data to database"""

- Docstrings shouldn't discuss implementation.

There should be sections in docstring for args returns and raises.

### Args
args: List params by names and describe them after a colon.

If it is too large and can't fit on 80 character line then second and below lines should be indented. Description should also contain type annotations.

### Returns

Describe type and semantics of the return value. Not required when None is returned.

### Exceptions

Lists all exceptions relevant to interface.

### Example

Note: Not my code. I should rewrite this (and all other obvious examples of ctrl c + ctrl v). Until then this is from University of York.

```py
def fetch_bigtable_rows( 
        big_table, 
        keys, 
        other_silly_variable=None): 
    """Fetches rows from a Bigtable.
    Retrieves rows pertaining to the given keys from the 
    Table instance represented by big_table.  Silly things
    may happen if other_silly_variable is not None.
    
    Args:
        big_table: An open Bigtable Table instance.
        keys: A sequence of strings representing the key
            of each table row to fetch.
        other_silly_variable: Another optional variable, 
            hat has a much longer name than the other 
        args, and which does nothing.

    Returns:
        A dict mapping keys to the corresponding table 
        row data fetched. Each row is represented as a
        tuple of strings. For example:

        {'Serak': ('Rigel VII', 'Preparer'),
         'Zim': ('Irk', 'Invader'),
         'Lrrr': ('Omicron Persei 8', 'Emperor')}

        If a key from the keys argument is missing from 
        the dictionary, then that row was not found in 
        the table.

    Raises:
        IOError: An error occurred accessing the 
            bigtable.Table object.
    """
```

## Modules

Should contain license boilerplate.
