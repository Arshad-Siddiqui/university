# Testing

- Ensures reliable and efficient code.
- Unit tests and tests of entire systems.

- However we're just focusing on unit tests for functions.

## Test Driven Development
Where you write tests before you write code. Serves as a guide for development.

Code is then written to satisfy these tests and then rewritten as you add more tests.

Makes the code easy to maintain and modify.

Also all them tests means it is well documented.

Assert statement makes testing easy. If assert fails then you know the test is bad.

> Testing isn't just for finding errors. Can be used to build robust dependable code.

```
def factorial(n):
  assert n > 0, "n must be positive"
```

## Limitations of assert statement.

- very simple and does not provide a comprehensive report.
- It also stops the execution of the program when a test fails.

## unit test

- python module which is a bit more robust.
- Is a built in module.
- Has a test runner that can run all tests in the program and provide a detailed report.
- Will be covered later.
