Detect duplicates problem

## Develop Pseudocode

- First we need to sort the array so it is easy to sift through. Could do binary search.
- Now all that's required is checking if an element is identical to an adjacent one.
- Could loop through 
```
def detect_duplicates(data):
  sorted_data = binary_search(data):
  for i from 1 to length(sorted_data - 1):
    if sorted_data[i] == sorted_data[i-1]
      return false
  return true
```
Best case scenario it finds a duplicate immediately and terminates with False.

Worst case it doesn't find a duplicate so checks the entire array. O(n) however that sorting step means we're looking at (n log(n)).
