# RAM Model of Computation and Big O Notation

## Introduction

- Practical way of measuring how relatively long an algorithm will take to run.

- Relies on assuming each operation, such as addition or comparison, takes a similar amount of time to run.

- Key part of analysis is seeing how the performance is effected by input size. This allows you to compare algorithms without needing particular hardware/software as you're just measuring the pattern associated with increasing input size.

- Will also cover big O notation. Just a clear and concise way to convey what input growth does to it.
