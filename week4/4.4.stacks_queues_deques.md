# 4.4 Lesson 2: Stacks, Queues and Deques

- Covering Abstract Data Types (ADTs).
- ADTs let us model data from behaviour instead of implementation.
- They make designing algorithms more efficient and intuitive.

## Stacks

LIFO(Last In Firt Out)

Where the last element put in is the first to be removed.

Useful for undo functionality and managing function calls.

Useful for matching delimiters: (), {}, []

### Push

Places new item on top of stack.

### Pop

Removes the top item from the top and returns it.

### Top

Check what is at the top without removing it.

### is_empty

Check is the stack is empty

### len/size

returns number of elements in the stack.

Above mostly runs at O(1)
