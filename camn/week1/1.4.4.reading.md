# ‚è±Ô∏è Delay, ‚ùå Loss, and üì∂ Throughput

## ‚è±Ô∏è Delay (Latency)

* **Definition**: The total time it takes for a packet to travel from sender to receiver.
* **Components of Delay**:

  1. **Processing delay** ‚Äì time to examine the packet header, check errors, decide where to forward it. Usually microseconds.
  2. **Queuing delay** ‚Äì time waiting in the router‚Äôs buffer before transmission. Depends on congestion.
  3. **Transmission delay** ‚Äì time to push all bits of the packet onto the link. Formula:

     $$
     d_{trans} = \frac{L}{R}
     $$

     where $L$ = packet length (bits), $R$ = link bandwidth (bps).
  4. **Propagation delay** ‚Äì time for signal to travel through the physical medium. Formula:

     $$
     d_{prop} = \frac{d}{s}
     $$

     where $d$ = distance, $s$ = signal speed (\~2x10^8 m/s in fiber).

**Total delay**:

$$
d_{total} = d_{proc} + d_{queue} + d_{trans} + d_{prop}
$$

## ‚ùå Loss

* **Definition**: Packets that never make it to their destination.
* **Causes**:

  * **Buffer overflow** at routers when queues are full.
  * **Bit errors** in transmission (rare on modern links, common on wireless).
  * **Timeouts/retransmissions** at higher layers (TCP).
* **Implications**:

  * Decreased throughput (since packets need retransmission).
  * Higher latency (waiting for retransmissions).
  * Poor Quality of Service (bad for real-time apps like VoIP or gaming).

## üì∂ Throughput

* **Definition**: The rate at which data is successfully delivered over a network.
* **Instantaneous throughput**: rate at a given instant.
* **Average throughput**: data delivered over a long period.
* **Bottleneck link**: throughput of a connection is limited by the slowest link on the path.

Example:
If sender pushes at 10 Mbps, but one link in the path only supports 2 Mbps ‚Üí max throughput = 2 Mbps.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs in Networking

* **Low delay** vs. **high throughput**:

  * High throughput can cause congestion ‚Üí increases queuing delay.
  * Low delay may require sacrificing throughput (e.g., reserving bandwidth).
* **Loss impacts throughput**: retransmissions waste bandwidth.
* **TCP congestion control** dynamically balances throughput vs. delay/loss.

## ‚ú® Real-World Examples

* **Video call (Zoom/Teams)**: needs low delay (<150 ms) and low loss.
* **File transfer (FTP/HTTP download)**: delay is less critical, but throughput matters most.
* **Gaming**: delay (ping) dominates user experience; high throughput is irrelevant once baseline needs are met.
