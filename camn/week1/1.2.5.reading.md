## Definition of a Protocol

* A **protocol** is a set of rules that govern communication between two (or more) entities in a network.
* It specifies:

  1. **Syntax** ‚Üí how data is formatted and structured.
  2. **Semantics** ‚Üí what the bits mean (interpretation of fields).
  3. **Timing** ‚Üí when and in what order messages are sent/received.

üëâ Think of a protocol as a **‚Äúlanguage‚Äù** both sides must speak to understand each other.

## Everyday Analogy

* Human conversation works only if both people understand the same **language rules** (greetings, turn-taking, meaning of words).
* Similarly, networked systems need protocols to:

  * Exchange data in a predictable order.
  * Know how to respond to certain messages.
  * Detect and handle errors or unexpected behaviour.

---

## Role in Networking

* Protocols define how applications and systems interact.
* Examples:

  * **HTTP** ‚Üí web browsing.
  * **SMTP** ‚Üí email.
  * **TCP/UDP** ‚Üí transport layer delivery.
  * **IP** ‚Üí addressing and routing packets.

Each layer of the network stack has its own set of protocols.

## Importance of Standardisation

* Standardisation ensures that different devices and software (built by different companies or in different countries) can interoperate.
* Without standardisation, two systems could:

  * Misinterpret data (wrong syntax).
  * Expect different message sequences.
  * Fail to establish or maintain communication.

**Example:** Imagine one device sends video in a compressed format unknown to the receiver ‚Üí the receiver cannot decode it.

---

## Consequences of No Shared Protocol

* **Breakdown in communication** ‚Üí messages are ignored or corrupted.
* **Incompatibility** ‚Üí devices or applications can‚Äôt interoperate.
* **Security risks** ‚Üí mismatched expectations might be exploited by attackers.
* **Fragmentation** ‚Üí isolated ‚Äúmini-networks‚Äù unable to connect globally.

## üîë Key Takeaway

Protocols are the **contracts of communication** in computer networks.
They make the Internet possible by ensuring billions of heterogeneous devices can exchange information **reliably, predictably, and securely**.

# 1.2.6 notes: Telnet

Protocols allow different systems to communicate. Thanks to email protocols an iphone can send an email to android.

## IP suite

Internet protocol suite can be broken down into 4 categories.

- Link layer - PPP, DSL, WIFI. Works at the hardware level.

- Internet layer - IPV4, IPV6. These initiate data transfers and route the data over the inernet.

- Transport Layer - TCP, UDP. To do with how packets are broken down, received, sent etc.

- Application layer - HTTP, IMAP, FTP. Specific protocols for specific apps. HTTPS is used to securely download a webpage.

## Telnet

- Really early communications protocol which is also one of the simplest.

- Uses client server principle where. Client application gives the user the terminal session on a remote computer.

- There was no security so intercepting it was easy allowing for data to be stolen.
