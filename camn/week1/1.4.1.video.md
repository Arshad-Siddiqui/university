# üîÄ Packet Switching vs Circuit Switching

## üåê Circuit Switching

* **Definition**: Communication method where a *dedicated communication path (circuit)* is established between sender and receiver for the entire duration of a session.
* **Analogy**: Like a traditional telephone call ‚Äî once a line is reserved, only you use it until the call ends.
* **Process**:

  1. **Connection setup**: A circuit is established end-to-end before data transmission begins.
  2. **Data transfer**: Fixed bandwidth allocated for that session, continuous stream.
  3. **Teardown**: Circuit is released when the session ends.
* **Advantages**:

  * Guaranteed bandwidth.
  * Low, predictable latency (good for real-time communication, e.g. voice).
  * Simpler error handling (since the path is fixed).
* **Disadvantages**:

  * Inefficient: circuit is reserved even if no data is being sent.
  * Poor scalability for bursty data traffic (like web browsing).
  * Higher setup delay (connection must be built first).

## üì¶ Packet Switching

* **Definition**: Data is broken into small *packets*, each transmitted independently and possibly taking different routes across the network.
* **Analogy**: Like sending letters through the postal system ‚Äî each one may take a different route, but they all eventually arrive at the destination.
* **Process**:

  1. Data divided into packets.
  2. Each packet carries headers (source, destination, sequence).
  3. Packets may travel independently across shared network paths.
  4. Receiver reassembles packets into original message.
* **Advantages**:

  * Efficient: no dedicated path, bandwidth is shared.
  * Robust: if one path fails, packets can be rerouted.
  * Scales well to millions of users.
* **Disadvantages**:

  * Packets may arrive out of order (need reassembly).
  * Variable latency (jitter).
  * Requires more complex protocols (TCP/IP).

## üîë Key Differences

| Feature    | Circuit Switching                     | Packet Switching                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Path       | Fixed, dedicated circuit              | Dynamic, packets may take different routes |
| Efficiency | Low (reserved bandwidth even if idle) | High (shared resources)                    |
| Latency    | Predictable, low                      | Variable, depends on traffic               |
| Setup time | High (must establish circuit first)   | Low (packets sent immediately)             |
| Best for   | Voice calls, streaming w/ QoS         | Internet traffic, bursty data              |

## ‚ú® Real-world context

* **Circuit switching**: Used in legacy PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network).
* **Packet switching**: Basis of the Internet (TCP/IP, UDP).
* Modern systems often use *packet switching* but add **QoS (Quality of Service)** techniques to mimic circuit-like guarantees when needed (e.g., for VoIP, video calls).
