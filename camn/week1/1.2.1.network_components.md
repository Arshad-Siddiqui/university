# Network components

Networks can be broken down into its physical and logical designs.

## Physical

- To do with the physical devices.

- Topology is to do with the layout of these devices and how they are all connected.

- Includes end devices which is what humans interact with such as phones, computers, printers...

- Intermediary devices facilitate these connections such as switch, hub etc..

- Network media are the channels in which data is transferred. So via ethernet, wifi, fibre.

## Logical

- Related to the configuration of devices. For instance...

- Protocols decide the rules that devices on the network follow.

- IP addressing, network addressing, routing, TCP and OSI models.

# Reading

Internet is just a really large network of computers. A lot of these devices connected to the internet are not traditional desktop computers so the collective term for all these is end devices or hosts.

## How programs running on different end systems send data

End systems attached to the internet provide a socket interface. The interface provides the rules for how it can be interacted with.

These rules are for the devices sending data so that it can reach the destination correctly.

Internet is typically given by 2 ways, DSL or cable

## DSL

Digital subscriber line

This type of internet is provided by the same company which provides your phone line. Therefore the telephone company is also the ISP.

Sends data over your phone wire back to your phone company. In order to stop the internet competing with phone calls data, data is sent over vastly different frequencies.

Typically you'd have a high speed upstream channel at the highest frequency range, a medium speed downstream channel at a medium frequency range a dd a low frequency channel for phone calls.

^ There's a built in speed difference between upload and download. Asymmetric.

This involves customers having a modem which is able to communicate with the digital subscribe line access multiplexer. Both the modem and the DSLAM can translate digital data into analogue for transfer over the phone line.

Per DSLAM can be hundreds of thousands of households.

The speed is limited by distance of modem to the central office. Typically these COs are no more than 5-10 miles away from the customers.

## Cable

Typically uses the technology for cable tv and the cable tv company becomes the ISP.

Uses a special cable modem that connects via coaxial cables to the fibre that goes back to the ISP.

There typically is shared speed between all the users so multiple people downloading a video at the same time will have a slower experience.

## Fiber to the home

New technology that is offering the fastest speeds. Fiber goes directly to the house. Each house gets a separate fiber connection. Important to note that a single fiber connection gets shared between multiple households but that it gets split up so a fiber cable reaches each individual house.

# ðŸ“˜ Notes on Chapter 1.2 & 1.3 â€” *Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (8th ed.)*

## 1.2 The Network Edge

### End Systems

* **End systems (hosts):** laptops, phones, servers.

  * Run **network applications** (e.g., browsers, email).
  * Located at the *edge* of the network.
* Classified as:

  * **Clients** â†’ request services (browsers, phones).
  * **Servers** â†’ provide services (web, email). Often in **data centers**.

---

### Access Networks

Access networks connect **end systems** to the **network core**.

* **Home access:**

  * **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line):** runs over existing telephone lines.
  * **Cable Internet (HFC: Hybrid Fiber-Coax):** uses same cable as TV.
  * **FTTH (Fiber to the Home):** direct optical fiber, very high speed.
  * **5G / WiFi:** wireless broadband alternatives.

* **Enterprise access:**

  * **Ethernet (LAN):** dominant technology, from 100 Mbps to 400 Gbps.
  * **WiFi networks** inside offices.

* **Wide-area wireless:**

  * 3G, 4G, 5G mobile networks.
  * Allow users to connect from almost anywhere.

---

### Physical Media

Data is transmitted as **bits over physical media**:

* **Twisted pair copper wires:** cheap, used in DSL, LAN.
* **Coaxial cable:** higher bandwidth, used in cable Internet.
* **Fiber optic cable:** very high speed, low loss, long distances.
* **Wireless (radio, satellite):** mobility, but subject to interference and distance limits.

---

## 1.3 The Network Core

The network core is the **mesh of interconnected routers and networks** that carries data between end systems.

---

### Two Key Switching Approaches

#### 1. Packet Switching

* Data split into **packets**.
* Each packet routed individually â†’ may take different paths.
* **Advantages:**

  * Efficient sharing of resources.
  * Resilient to failures (alternate paths possible).
* **Disadvantages:**

  * Variable delays (queuing, congestion).
  * Possible packet loss.

#### 2. Circuit Switching

* Pre-allocates **dedicated resources** (bandwidth, path) for a session.
* Examples: traditional telephone networks.
* **Advantages:**

  * Predictable performance (guaranteed bandwidth).
* **Disadvantages:**

  * Inefficient â€” resources sit idle if not fully used.

---

### A Network of Networks

* Internet is **not one single network** â†’ itâ€™s a hierarchy:

  * **Tier-1 ISPs:** global backbones.
  * **Regional ISPs:** connect to Tier-1s.
  * **Access ISPs:** connect homes/businesses.
* **Peering links** and **IXPs (Internet Exchange Points):** where ISPs interconnect.
* Hierarchical structure enables **scalability**.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways

* **Network edge = hosts + access networks + physical media.**
* **Network core = packet-switched network of routers.**
* **Packet switching** dominates todayâ€™s Internet (flexible, efficient).
* **Circuit switching** is more predictable but wasteful.
* The **Internetâ€™s hierarchy** (Tier-1, regional, access ISPs) makes it scalable.
