# UDP Socket Programming

UDP allows processes running on different hosts to communicate. Different to TCP there is no handshake to set up a pipe. Instead each packet being sent has a destination address.

The destination address is the IP address and the port.

UDP is unreliable in that it doesn't guarantee the packet makes its destination.

2.3.3 has as decent programming exercise.
