# 🌍 DNS & Name Resolution

*(Domain Name System — turning human-friendly names into machine-usable addresses)*

---

## 🧠 What Is DNS?

**DNS (Domain Name System)** is like the **Internet’s phonebook** — it translates **human-readable names** (like `www.google.com`) into **machine-readable IP addresses** (like `142.250.187.36`).

Computers need IPs to communicate, but humans prefer words — DNS bridges that gap.

## 🏷️ Hostnames, Domain Names & FQDNs

| Term                                   | Meaning                                                                                                                            | Example           |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Hostname**                           | The name given to an individual machine (a single device on a network).                                                            | `www` or `mail`   |
| **Domain Name**                        | A broader label representing an organisation or entity’s space on the internet.                                                    | `google.com`      |
| **FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)** | The *complete* name that uniquely identifies a host in the DNS hierarchy. Includes the hostname + domain + top-level domain (TLD). | `www.google.com.` |

> 🪄 Tip: The trailing dot (`.`) represents the *root* of the DNS hierarchy — though it’s usually omitted in browsers.

## 🏗️ The DNS Hierarchy (Tree of Names)

The DNS namespace is **hierarchical**, structured like an inverted tree 🌳:

```
                 .
                 |
      -----------------------
      |          |          |
     com        org        net   ← Top-Level Domains (TLDs)
      |
   google
      |
     www                   ← Hostname
```

### Levels:

1. **Root Zone (.)** — The top of the hierarchy (13 root server clusters worldwide).
2. **Top-Level Domain (TLD)** — `.com`, `.org`, `.edu`, `.uk`, etc.
3. **Second-Level Domain (SLD)** — e.g., `google` in `google.com`.
4. **Subdomain** — e.g., `mail.google.com` or `support.apple.com`.
5. **Host (A record)** — The final destination; the actual server IP.

---

## ⚙️ Host Name Resolution (Local)

Before querying DNS, systems check locally:

1. **Hosts File**

   * Located at `/etc/hosts` (Linux/macOS) or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` (Windows).
   * Maps hostnames to IPs manually, like a personal mini-DNS.
   * Example:

     ```
     127.0.0.1   localhost
     192.168.0.5 myprinter
     ```
   * Useful for testing or overriding DNS.

2. **Local Cache**

   * The OS/browser caches previously resolved names.
   * Speeds up repeat visits to the same site.

If neither the cache nor the hosts file has the info → the system uses **DNS Name Resolution**.

---

## 🌐 DNS Name Resolution (Network-Based)

### Two Main Types:

#### 🧭 1. Recursive Resolution

The client (resolver) asks one DNS server to **do all the work** — that server queries other servers on behalf of the client and returns the final IP address.

* Common for end-user devices (your laptop, phone).
* Your ISP or Google DNS (8.8.8.8) usually handles recursion.

#### 🪜 2. Iterative Resolution

Each DNS server replies with the **best information it has** — often a referral to another server closer to the answer. The client follows the chain step by step.

---

## 🧩 Example: Resolving `www.example.com`

1. **Browser checks local cache**

   * If not found → OS checks `/etc/hosts`.
2. **OS asks DNS Resolver** (usually your ISP’s DNS or a public one like Cloudflare `1.1.1.1`).
3. **Resolver checks its cache.**

   * If cached → returns IP immediately.
4. **If not cached:**

   1. Queries the **Root DNS Server** → gets address of `.com` TLD server.
   2. Queries **TLD Server** → gets address of `example.com` authoritative server.
   3. Queries **Authoritative Name Server** for `www.example.com`.
   4. Receives the final IP address.
5. Resolver returns the IP to your computer.
6. Browser connects to the web server via that IP.

```
Client → Resolver → Root → TLD (.com) → Authoritative (example.com) → IP found → Back to Client
```

💡 *This all happens in milliseconds.*

## 🧱 DNS Record Types

| Record    | Purpose                                            | Example                               |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **A**     | Maps a hostname to an IPv4 address.                | `www → 192.0.2.1`                     |
| **AAAA**  | Maps a hostname to an IPv6 address.                | `www → 2001:db8::1`                   |
| **CNAME** | Alias for another name (canonical name).           | `mail.example.com → www.example.com`  |
| **MX**    | Mail Exchange — specifies mail servers.            | `@example.com → mailhost.example.com` |
| **NS**    | Nameserver records — delegate authority.           | `example.com → ns1.example.net`       |
| **TXT**   | Misc. text (e.g., SPF, DKIM, domain verification). | `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com`      |

---

## ⚡ Caching and TTL (Time to Live)

* Every DNS record has a **TTL value** — how long it can be cached before rechecking.
* Example: TTL = 3600 seconds (1 hour).
* Caching reduces traffic and speeds up resolution but can delay DNS updates.

## 🔒 DNS Security & Modern Extensions

| Feature       | Description                                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DNSSEC**    | Digitally signs DNS responses to prevent tampering (protects against DNS spoofing). |
| **DoH / DoT** | DNS over HTTPS / DNS over TLS — encrypts DNS queries to prevent surveillance.       |
| **Split DNS** | Different DNS responses for internal vs. external users — used in enterprises.      |

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Concept                    | Description                                                                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Host Name**              | Name of an individual device (`printer01`, `www`).                         |
| **Domain Name**            | Group/organisation (`google.com`).                                         |
| **FQDN**                   | Full unique path including all hierarchy (`www.google.com.`).              |
| **Host Name Resolution**   | Local lookup (cache or hosts file).                                        |
| **DNS Resolution**         | Network-based lookup through DNS servers.                                  |
| **Recursive vs Iterative** | Recursive: DNS does the work for you. Iterative: You follow the referrals. |

## 💡 Why It Matters

* DNS makes the Internet usable for humans.
* It’s critical for **scalability**, **load balancing**, and **redundancy**.
* Understanding the resolution flow helps you **debug connectivity** (e.g., ping failures, website downtime).
* Without standardised DNS, each network would need its own naming system — global interoperability would collapse.

✅ **In Short:**

> DNS converts *names to numbers* through a beautifully layered and cached system — combining simplicity for humans with scalability for the Internet.

# Video notes

Computers/browsers like their ip address which is a bunch of numbers. Humans don't like those as they are hard to remember and prefer words like google.com

DNS changes words into ip addresses. DNS is a bunch of different servers. (distributed system)

Each DNS server knows how to do its job. If it receives a an address it doesn't know it keeps pointers to another server which might have the ip.

Root name servers only know about .com .uk .net etc.
