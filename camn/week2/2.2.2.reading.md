# 🌐 Principles of Networking Applications

## 🔑 The Application Layer

* **Definition**: The top layer of the network stack, where user-facing network applications live (e.g., web browsers, email clients, file-sharing apps).
* **Goal**: Allow distributed processes (programs running on different end systems) to communicate and provide useful services.
* **Key Point**: Applications use the network but are insulated from low-level transmission details. They rely on the lower layers (transport, network, link, physical).

## 🧑‍💻 Distributed Processes & Communication

* Applications are often **distributed systems** → multiple processes running on different hosts coordinate to perform tasks.
* **Processes** communicate by exchanging **messages** over the network.
* **Endpoints**: The process and its host’s network interface (identified by IP + port).

## 🏗️ Application Architectures

### 1. Client-Server Model

* **Structure**:

  * **Client**: initiates communication, requests services (e.g., browser).
  * **Server**: always-on host, listens for requests, provides services (e.g., web server).
* **Characteristics**:

  * Servers usually have fixed IP addresses.
  * Scalable via **data centers** and **server farms**.
  * Reliability: if server goes down → service unavailable.
* **Examples**: Web (HTTP), Email (SMTP, IMAP), FTP.

### 2. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Model

* **Structure**: End systems (peers) communicate directly without relying on a dedicated server.
* **Characteristics**:

  * Peers can act as both clients and servers.
  * Self-scalable: more peers → more resources.
  * Reliability depends on availability of peers.
  * No always-on infrastructure required.
* **Examples**: BitTorrent, Skype (original), blockchain systems.

### 3. Hybrid Approaches

* Many modern systems combine **client-server** and **P2P**.
* Example:

  * Skype uses a central server for login/authentication.
  * Once connected, calls are peer-to-peer.

## 🧩 Sockets: The Programming Interface

* A **socket** is the interface between an application process and the transport layer.
* Acts like a **door** between the process and the network.
* An application writes data to a socket → transport layer handles packaging and delivery.
* Identified by **(IP address, Port number)**.

## 📈 Service Requirements of Applications

Different apps require different **service guarantees** from the underlying transport layer (TCP or UDP):

1. **Reliability**

   * Email, file transfer → require 100% reliable delivery.
   * Video/voice streaming → can tolerate some loss.

2. **Latency (Delay)**

   * Real-time apps (gaming, video calls) require **low delay**.
   * File downloads care less about delay; throughput is more important.

3. **Throughput**

   * Streaming services need guaranteed throughput (enough to keep buffer full).
   * Small messages (chat) need less throughput.

4. **Scalability**

   * Client-server models scale via more servers/data centers.
   * P2P scales by adding more peers.

## 🚦 Summary

* The **application layer** defines how distributed processes interact.
* **Architectures**: Client-server, P2P, or hybrids.
* **Sockets** provide the programming API for process communication.
* Applications differ in their **requirements** (reliability, delay, throughput, scalability).
* Choosing the right architecture + transport service is key to application performance.
