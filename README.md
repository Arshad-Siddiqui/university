# Storing all my uni notes here

Start [here.](/algorithms/week1/1.2.3.insertion.md) :)

WARNING!: I like to pretend that I know what I'm on about. Most of the notes here are a product of me handing my notes to ChatGPT to proof read and make look pretty. You can often tell what is mine by how trash it looks and if it is filled with emojis or not.
