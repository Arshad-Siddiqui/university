# 🖥️ Chapter 4: Computers Everywhere – Summary

### 📌 4.1 A Machine With Many Facets

* Not all computer systems look like laptops or desktops.
* Devices like **microwaves, dishwashers, or electric toothbrushes** can also contain embedded computers.
* The **type of computer system** used depends on the problem — tailored solutions are often **more efficient and cost-effective**.

---

### 💻 4.2–4.3 General-Purpose Computers

* Evolved from bulky, task-specific machines to **mass-produced, flexible systems**.
* **Examples**: Desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets.
* Typical features:

  * Large memory & storage (e.g., 8–32GB RAM, 500GB–1TB disk)
  * Mass-market components
  * Supports multiple operating systems & applications
  * Various input/output ports
* ⚠️ Trade-off: Not optimal for specific high-performance tasks.

### 📱 4.3.1 The Computer in Your Hand

* Modern smartphones and tablets are also **general-purpose computers**.
* Optimised for **media-rich apps** and run on compact, power-efficient chips (e.g., **Apple A11, Snapdragon, Exynos**).
* Feature **System-on-Chip (SoC)**: combines CPU, GPU, and other functions into one chip.

---

### 🔧 4.3.2 The Hidden Computer (Embedded Systems)

* **Embedded systems** are specialised computers within everyday devices.
* You don't interact with them like normal PCs.
* Examples:

  * Appliances: microwave, washing machine
  * Electronics: digital locks, printers, TVs
  * Automotive: engine control units, key fobs
  * Critical systems: aircraft, medical devices
* Key requirements:

  * **Real-time computing**, **fault tolerance**, **low power**, **security**, and **reliability**

---

### 🎯 4.4 Application-Specific Systems

Used for **high-performance or special-purpose tasks**, including:

* **Weather forecasting** – real-time, intensive simulations
* **Search engines** – handle massive queries/data
* **AI processing** – e.g., **Google TPU**, custom neural network chips
* **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** – audio, radar, imaging
* **Space/nuclear** – fault-tolerant, radiation-hardened systems
* **Gaming/media** – GPUs, SSDs for high performance
* These systems **trade flexibility for speed, efficiency, or durability**.

### 🧠 4.5 Impact on Processor Technology

* Processors are highly varied to fit their domains.
* Table 4.1 lists types like:

  * **General-purpose CPUs**: Intel i7, AMD Ryzen
  * **Mobile**: Apple A7, Cortex-A57
  * **DSPs**: SIGMA ADAU1787
  * **AI chips**: Google TPU, IBM True North
  * **Embedded**: ATMEGA2560, XMC4000
  * **GPUs**: GeForce MX110, AMD Polaris

### 🏢 4.6 Mainframes and Supercomputers

#### 🔷 Mainframes:

* Designed for **multi-user environments** (e.g., insurance companies).
* Use **time-slicing** to simulate simultaneous user access via **dumb terminals**.
* Modern equivalents: **cloud computing**, **thin clients**, and **servers**.

#### 🔷 Supercomputers:

* Designed for **massive, specialised computation** (e.g., astrophysics, weather models).
* Use **thousands of processors**, **petabytes of storage**, and **terabytes of RAM**.
* Performance measured in **FLOPs** (floating-point operations per second).
* Examples: CRAY EL98, Top-500 supercomputers.
* Some projects like **SETI\@Home** crowdsource computing power globally.

### 🌐 4.7 The Internet of Things (IoT)

* Not fully shown here, but this section continues the theme of **ubiquitous computing** — everyday objects becoming "smart" through embedded processors and connectivity.
