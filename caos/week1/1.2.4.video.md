# 🧠 Von Neumann Architecture Explained

The **Von Neumann architecture** is a foundational computer design model introduced by John von Neumann in the 1940s. It's still the basis for most modern digital computers today.

## 🔧 Core Components

A Von Neumann machine consists of three key parts:

1. **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** – Executes instructions and performs calculations.
2. **Memory** – Stores both data and instructions in a single shared memory space.
3. **I/O Devices (Input/Output)** – Communicates with external devices like keyboards, displays, printers, etc.

All these components are connected via the:

### 🔁 System Bus

* A **bus** is a communication pathway.
* In Von Neumann architecture, a **single bus** connects the CPU, memory, and I/O.
* This means data **and instructions share the same communication channel**.

## 🧱 The Von Neumann Bottleneck

The **Von Neumann bottleneck** refers to a major limitation of this architecture:

* The **bus cannot transmit data in both directions simultaneously**.
* CPU and memory must **take turns** accessing the bus.
* This causes delays and limits performance, especially with modern high-speed processors.

## 🧠 Evolution: Adding Cache

To address the bottleneck:

* **Cache memory** was introduced.
* Cache is **small, fast memory** located close to the CPU.
* Frequently used data is stored here to reduce bus traffic and latency.

# ⏱️ Clock Signals

## 💡 What is a Clock Signal?

* A **clock signal** is an oscillating voltage that alternates between two levels (usually representing binary `0` and `1`).
* It serves as the **heartbeat of a computer**, timing and synchronizing operations.

### Rising and Falling Edge

* **Rising edge**: Signal changes from 0 to 1.
* **Falling edge**: Signal changes from 1 to 0.
* A **full clock cycle** includes both a rising and falling edge.

```
Visual Example:  
_|-|_|-|_| (Each |_ or -| is an edge)
```

### ⏱️ Time and Frequency

* Each clock cycle takes a time `t`.
* The **frequency** of the clock is `f = 1 / t` (measured in Hz).
* A 1 GHz clock means 1 billion cycles per second.

### 📋 Why the Clock Matters

* Every key event (e.g. data movement, instruction fetch) is aligned to a clock edge.
* Ensures **synchronized execution** and prevents conflicts between components.

# ➕ Adders

## 🧮 Half Adder

* Takes **two binary inputs** and outputs:

  * A **sum bit**
  * A **carry bit**
* Cannot take a carry-in bit (from a previous addition).

## ➕ Full Adder

* Takes **three inputs**:

  * Two data bits + one carry-in
* Outputs:

  * A sum and a carry-out
* Full adders can be **chained together** to create circuits capable of adding multi-bit binary numbers.
