Von Neuman machine is CPU, Memory and IO.

There is also a system bus connecting these components.

Neumann bottleneck refers to the bus not being able to go both directions at the same time. It has to take turns going from cpu to memory and vice versa.

Cache later got added to the model. It's basically just smaller/faster memory.

# Clock signal

Just a voltage that turns on and off. represents 1 and 0

Comprised of rising edge and falling edge where the clock signal transfers from 0 to 1 and the reverse.

A rising edge and falling edge forms 1 clock cycle. So a full clock cycle involves going from 0 to 1 and back to 0.

|-|_

This takes a certain amount of time t

1/t = frequency

Each clock cycle is associated with an event. The clock cycle ensure the events are synchronised and not overlapping.

## Half and full adders

A half adder takes 2 inputs and adds them together. It then returns that result.

A full adder can take a third input. Good for chaining additions.
