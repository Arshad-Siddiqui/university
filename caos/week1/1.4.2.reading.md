## üì¶ Embedded Systems

### ‚úÖ What is an Embedded System?

An **embedded system** is a computer system designed for a **specific function** within a larger system. It combines hardware, software, and sometimes mechanical parts to perform a dedicated task.

üîπ **Example**: An anti-lock braking system in a car.

### üìå Key Characteristics

* **Purpose-built**: Not general-purpose like laptops or desktops.
* **Constraints** vary widely:

  * **Size & Cost**: From small sensors to large industrial machines.
  * **Performance Requirements**: Ranges from relaxed to very strict, depending on use case (e.g., real-time medical devices).
  * **Lifespan**: Can be short (disposable) or long (industrial machinery).
  * **Environment**: Operate under diverse conditions like high temperature, radiation, or vibration.
  * **Timing Requirements**: Real-time systems must respond within strict time constraints.
  * **Task Types**: Can be compute-heavy, interface-heavy, or a mix.
  * **Computation Models**: Some are event-driven; others involve continuous processes (hybrid systems).

### üîß Common Features in Embedded Systems

* **Special Interfaces** to interact with the environment (e.g., sensors).
* **Minimal user interface**, often just a light or button.
* **Diagnostics ports** to monitor or control external hardware.
* **Special-purpose hardware**: May include ASICs, FPGAs, or analog components.
* **Fixed-function software**, tailored for the application.

### üß† Why They Matter

Embedded systems are used **everywhere**, vastly outnumbering general-purpose computers.

## üß† ARM Architecture

### ‚úÖ What is ARM?

**ARM** (originally Acorn RISC Machine, now simply "ARM") is a family of **RISC-based** (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors. ARM Ltd. designs the architecture and licenses it to manufacturers.

### üí° Why ARM is So Dominant

* **Small die size**
* **Low power consumption**
* **High performance**
* **Ideal for mobile and embedded applications**
* **Extremely wide adoption**: Used in phones, tablets, smart devices, automotive, and more.
* ARM is **the most widely used processor architecture** in the world.

### üìú History & Evolution

* **1980s**: Developed by Acorn Computers for BBC‚Äôs literacy project.
* **ARM1 (1985)**: Used for internal research.
* **ARM2/ARM3**: First commercial chips, small and power-efficient.
* **ARM Ltd.** was formed by Acorn, Apple, and VLSI Technology to further develop the architecture.
