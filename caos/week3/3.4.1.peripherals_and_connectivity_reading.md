# **Notes on Peripherals, Interfaces, and Networking**

## 8.1 Everyday Peripherals

* **Peripherals** extend the computer’s capabilities.
  Two main categories:

  * **Input devices** → bring data *into* the computer.
  * **Output devices** → send information *out* to the user.

### Common Input Devices

* **Keyboard** – low data rate, each key press generates scancodes (rows/columns), often 1–3 bytes.
* **Mouse** – tracks tiny movements, transmitting hundreds of bytes per second.
* **Touchpads/Touchscreens** – enable multi-touch, gestures, direct screen interaction.
* **Stylus/Tablets** – allow pen-like input, precise for drawing/annotation.
* **Microphones** – for audio input, voice commands, conferencing.
* **Cameras** – capture video/stills, now extended for motion/gesture recognition and even 3D scanning.

### Common Output Devices

* **Video Displays/Projectors** – massive data requirements, pixels rendered at 24-bit color, 50+ frames/sec.
* **Printers** – laser or inkjet, spool jobs via USB/WiFi/Ethernet. High-quality output requires millions of dots (pixels) per page.
* **GPUs** – offload video rendering from CPU, essential for modern graphics.
* **Audio Devices** – digital signal processors handle compression (e.g., MP3), playback, and effects.

## 8.2 Novel Peripheral Interfaces

* **Haptics** – tactile interaction (force feedback, vibration, pressure).
* **Data gloves** – track finger/hand movement for VR.
* **Gesture tracking** – uses cameras + AI for input.
* **Haptic feedback** – e.g., vibration controllers, ultrasonic feedback to simulate virtual touch.

## 8.3 Networking Connectivity

### Wired Networks

* **Ethernet** – dominant wired standard, speeds from 10 Mbps to multi-Gbps.

  * Uses **CSMA/CD** (Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection).
  * Efficient but non-deterministic (can’t *guarantee* service time).
* **ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)** – guarantees QoS (time slots reserved), used in specialised systems.

### Wireless Networks

* **WiFi** – wireless Ethernet, convenient but prone to interference and security risks. Data rates vary (tens of Mbps–Gbps).
* **Bluetooth** – short-range (a few metres), low-power, low bandwidth (2–24 Mbps). Ideal for mobile peripherals (keyboards, earbuds, wearables).

### Network Protocols & Overheads

* **Packets** – each transmission has a **header (protocol info)** + **payload (user data)** + error checks (CRC).
* **Efficiency** = Payload / (Payload + Header).

  * Example: Ethernet packets range from \~72% efficiency (small payloads) to \~99% efficiency (large payloads).
* **Trade-off**: Larger payloads → higher throughput but worse latency.

  * Example: Gaming prefers shorter packets for low lag.
* Bandwidth vs. Latency → balance depends on use case.

## **Implications & Questions**

### 1. How do emerging peripheral interfaces enhance interaction, accessibility, and productivity?

* **Multi-touch, stylus, VR, haptics** → richer, more natural interaction.
* **Accessibility** – voice input, gesture control, and tactile feedback expand usability for people with disabilities.
* **Productivity** – specialised input (stylus for designers, VR gloves for engineers) enables more intuitive workflows and faster creative processes.

### 2. How do network protocols and overheads affect system performance and wired vs. wireless design?

* **Wired (Ethernet)** → high bandwidth, lower interference, more predictable. Suited for high-performance or latency-sensitive tasks (e.g., servers, gaming rigs).
* **Wireless (WiFi/Bluetooth)** → mobility and convenience, but overhead from retransmissions, signal interference, and security measures can reduce efficiency.
* **Protocol overheads** mean not all bandwidth is usable → system designers must optimise payload size, packet handling, and choose between **bandwidth prioritisation (throughput)** vs. **latency minimisation (real-time responsiveness)**.
* Example: Video streaming benefits from large packets (bandwidth), while gaming/chat apps need small packets (low latency).
