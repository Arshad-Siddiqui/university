# How networks work: models, security and efficiency

- Looking over OSI reference model and then looking at TCP/IP model to compare with.

Here’s a set of clean, detailed notes on 

**Chapter 13, sections 13.1–13.5**, with your two guiding questions folded in. I kept the style “swaggy” but also structured so it’ll click quickly when you revise.

# Networking Fundamentals (OSI, TCP/IP, Structures)

## Context

* Networks scale from tiny (smartwatch → phone) to global (ISS internet).
* OS support makes remote devices feel local (e.g., thermostat vs. polar sensor).
* Networking enables shared resources, distributed computing, and virtualisation (many virtual desktops from one machine).

## OSI Reference Model

A **theoretical 7-layer framework**. Each layer abstracts complexity from the one below.

1. **Physical Layer** – Wires, signals, voltages.
2. **Data Link Layer** – Frames, error detection (CRC/parity).
3. **Network Layer** – Routing, addressing (IP).
4. **Transport Layer** – Reliable data transfer, multiplexing sessions (e.g., TCP).
5. **Session Layer** – Manages ongoing connections.
6. **Presentation Layer** – Data translation, encryption, formatting.
7. **Application Layer** – User-facing software (e.g., browsers, email).

✨ Key point: **Errors are corrected at lower levels so apps don’t see them.**

## TCP/IP Model

A **practical 4-layer implementation** (a compressed OSI):

* Application → (covers App, Presentation, Session in OSI)
* Transport → TCP/UDP
* Internet → IP (routing & addressing)
* Link → Physical + Data link

➡ TCP/IP = simpler, dominant in real-world networking.

## Security

* Exists at multiple layers.
* **End-to-end encryption** (app layer, e.g., WhatsApp).
* **Link-layer encryption** (e.g., Wi-Fi WPA2).
* Layered approach means redundancy: security at multiple levels.

## Network Structures

### Shared Medium (basic LAN/Wi-Fi)

* All devices on one channel → contend for bandwidth.
* Doesn’t scale well as nodes increase.

### Bridging

* **Bridge** = joins two networks *or* splits one into segments.
* Filters traffic so local comms stay local.
* Example: Node A talks to B locally while Node C talks to D elsewhere—no interference.
* Improves scalability and effective bandwidth.

### Switching

* **Switch** = multi-port bridge.
* Smarter: knows which port leads to which device.
* Supports multiple simultaneous comms (segmentation + filtering).
* Scales better than simple bridges.

### Routing

* Decides best path between networks.
* **Static routing** = fixed rules (fast, but no fault tolerance).
* **Dynamic routing** = adapts in real-time using routing info exchange; handles congestion and failures.
* Routers often connect LAN → Internet.

## Key Takeaways

### OSI vs. TCP/IP layering

* OSI = **theory, detailed abstraction**.
* TCP/IP = **practical, simplified** (used in real systems).
* Importance: OSI is a teaching framework; TCP/IP is how the internet actually works.

### Bridging, Switching, Routing

* **Bridging** improves bandwidth by segmenting traffic.
* **Switching** generalises bridging with more connections and filtering.
* **Routing** scales to global networks, ensuring data finds efficient, resilient paths.

## Questions of the Day (Answered)

**Q: How do the OSI and TCP/IP models differ in their approach to layering, and why is this distinction significant in real-world networking scenarios?**

* OSI = 7-layer, detailed, conceptual. TCP/IP = 4-layer, practical.
* In reality, protocols don’t always map neatly to OSI, so TCP/IP is used for implementation. OSI still matters for **teaching, troubleshooting, and conceptual clarity.**

**Q: In what ways do bridging, switching, and routing each contribute to efficient and secure data transmission across modern networks?**

* **Bridging** reduces collisions by dividing traffic into segments.
* **Switching** enables multiple simultaneous paths and efficient bandwidth use.
* **Routing** chooses best paths globally, adapting to failures and congestion.
  ➡ Together, they ensure scalability, efficiency, and reliability in both LANs and WANs.
