# How networks work: models, security and efficiency

- Looking over OSI reference model and then looking at TCP/IP model to compare with.

Here‚Äôs a set of clean, detailed notes on 

**Chapter 13, sections 13.1‚Äì13.5**, with your two guiding questions folded in. I kept the style ‚Äúswaggy‚Äù but also structured so it‚Äôll click quickly when you revise.

# Networking Fundamentals (OSI, TCP/IP, Structures)

## Context

* Networks scale from tiny (smartwatch ‚Üí phone) to global (ISS internet).
* OS support makes remote devices feel local (e.g., thermostat vs. polar sensor).
* Networking enables shared resources, distributed computing, and virtualisation (many virtual desktops from one machine).

## OSI Reference Model

A **theoretical 7-layer framework**. Each layer abstracts complexity from the one below.

1. **Physical Layer** ‚Äì Wires, signals, voltages.
2. **Data Link Layer** ‚Äì Frames, error detection (CRC/parity).
3. **Network Layer** ‚Äì Routing, addressing (IP).
4. **Transport Layer** ‚Äì Reliable data transfer, multiplexing sessions (e.g., TCP).
5. **Session Layer** ‚Äì Manages ongoing connections.
6. **Presentation Layer** ‚Äì Data translation, encryption, formatting.
7. **Application Layer** ‚Äì User-facing software (e.g., browsers, email).

‚ú® Key point: **Errors are corrected at lower levels so apps don‚Äôt see them.**

---

## TCP/IP Model

A **practical 4-layer implementation** (a compressed OSI):

* Application ‚Üí (covers App, Presentation, Session in OSI)
* Transport ‚Üí TCP/UDP
* Internet ‚Üí IP (routing & addressing)
* Link ‚Üí Physical + Data link

‚û° TCP/IP = simpler, dominant in real-world networking.

---

## Security

* Exists at multiple layers.
* **End-to-end encryption** (app layer, e.g., WhatsApp).
* **Link-layer encryption** (e.g., Wi-Fi WPA2).
* Layered approach means redundancy: security at multiple levels.

---

## Network Structures

### Shared Medium (basic LAN/Wi-Fi)

* All devices on one channel ‚Üí contend for bandwidth.
* Doesn‚Äôt scale well as nodes increase.

### Bridging

* **Bridge** = joins two networks *or* splits one into segments.
* Filters traffic so local comms stay local.
* Example: Node A talks to B locally while Node C talks to D elsewhere‚Äîno interference.
* Improves scalability and effective bandwidth.

### Switching

* **Switch** = multi-port bridge.
* Smarter: knows which port leads to which device.
* Supports multiple simultaneous comms (segmentation + filtering).
* Scales better than simple bridges.

### Routing

* Decides best path between networks.
* **Static routing** = fixed rules (fast, but no fault tolerance).
* **Dynamic routing** = adapts in real-time using routing info exchange; handles congestion and failures.
* Routers often connect LAN ‚Üí Internet.

## Key Takeaways

### OSI vs. TCP/IP layering

* OSI = **theory, detailed abstraction**.
* TCP/IP = **practical, simplified** (used in real systems).
* Importance: OSI is a teaching framework; TCP/IP is how the internet actually works.

### Bridging, Switching, Routing

* **Bridging** improves bandwidth by segmenting traffic.
* **Switching** generalises bridging with more connections and filtering.
* **Routing** scales to global networks, ensuring data finds efficient, resilient paths.

## Questions of the Day (Answered)

**Q: How do the OSI and TCP/IP models differ in their approach to layering, and why is this distinction significant in real-world networking scenarios?**

* OSI = 7-layer, detailed, conceptual. TCP/IP = 4-layer, practical.
* In reality, protocols don‚Äôt always map neatly to OSI, so TCP/IP is used for implementation. OSI still matters for **teaching, troubleshooting, and conceptual clarity.**

**Q: In what ways do bridging, switching, and routing each contribute to efficient and secure data transmission across modern networks?**

* **Bridging** reduces collisions by dividing traffic into segments.
* **Switching** enables multiple simultaneous paths and efficient bandwidth use.
* **Routing** chooses best paths globally, adapting to failures and congestion.
  ‚û° Together, they ensure scalability, efficiency, and reliability in both LANs and WANs.

# Networking Continued (Sections 13.6‚Äì13.13)

## 13.6 Node Identity and Addressing

* Every node needs a **unique ID** to avoid chaos.
* Two main layers of identity:

  * **MAC address** ‚Üí Hardware-level, fixed at manufacture (like a serial number).
  * **IP address** ‚Üí Software-level, logical, can change depending on network.

‚ú® Analogy: **MAC** = permanent ‚Äúpassport number.‚Äù **IP** = temporary ‚Äústreet address.‚Äù

---

## 13.7 Network Services

* Networks provide services beyond raw connectivity.
* Examples:

  * **DNS (Domain Name System)** ‚Äì translates human-readable names (google.com) into IPs.
  * **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** ‚Äì assigns IPs automatically.
  * **NAT (Network Address Translation)** ‚Äì allows many devices to share one public IP.
* Services make networking **usable** and **scalable** for humans.

---

## 13.8 Distributed Systems

* Systems where multiple computers work together as one.
* **Key features**:

  * Transparency (users don‚Äôt know/care where computation happens).
  * Fault tolerance (if one node dies, others take over).
  * Scalability (more machines = more capacity).
* Examples:

  * Google search backend.
  * Multiplayer game servers.
  * Hadoop clusters for big data.

---

## 13.9 Cloud Computing

* **Cloud** = distributed systems exposed as services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
* **Benefits**:

  * Elasticity (scale up/down as needed).
  * Cost efficiency (pay-as-you-go).
  * Accessibility (anywhere with internet).
* **Risks**:

  * Vendor lock-in.
  * Security concerns (data outside your control).
  * Latency compared to local processing.

---

## 13.10 Virtualisation

* Using one physical machine to **host multiple virtual machines (VMs)**.
* Each VM acts as if it‚Äôs a separate physical computer.
* **Hypervisor** = software layer that manages VMs.

  * **Type 1** ‚Äì runs directly on hardware (bare-metal).
  * **Type 2** ‚Äì runs on top of a host OS.
* Benefits:

  * Consolidation of workloads.
  * Easier testing/deployment.
  * Isolation between systems.

---

## 13.11 Containerisation

* A lighter alternative to full virtualisation.
* Containers share the same OS kernel but run isolated environments.
* Example: **Docker**.
* **Why containers?**

  * Faster startup vs VMs.
  * Less resource-heavy.
  * Great for microservices.

---

## 13.12 Reliability and Redundancy

* Networks must be fault-tolerant.
* **Strategies**:

  * Redundant links (multiple paths between nodes).
  * Failover mechanisms (automatic switchover).
  * Data replication across multiple nodes.
* Trade-off: **Reliability vs cost**.

---

## 13.13 Security in Networking

* **Authentication**: ensuring who you‚Äôre talking to is who they claim.
* **Encryption**: keeping data private in transit.
* **Firewalls**: controlling what traffic comes in/out.
* **IDS/IPS**: intrusion detection/prevention.

‚ú® Security spans **all layers** of OSI/TCP models.

# üîë Key Takeaways (Sections 13.6‚Äì13.13)

* **Node IDs (MAC/IP)** are critical for addressing and routing traffic.
* **Network services** (DNS, DHCP, NAT) make networks human-friendly and scalable.
* **Distributed + cloud systems** show how networking powers modern apps and infrastructure.
* **Virtualisation + containers** = core to efficient, scalable compute infrastructure.
* **Reliability & security** are built with redundancy, fault tolerance, and layered defences.

‚ö° **Q wrap-up**

* **How do the OSI and TCP/IP models differ in layering?**
  OSI = conceptual 7 layers; TCP/IP = practical 4 layers. OSI = theory, TCP/IP = real-world backbone.

* **Bridging, switching, routing roles?**

  * Bridging = divides networks to reduce collisions.
  * Switching = scales bridging with multiple paths.
  * Routing = finds best paths globally, adapting to failures.

* **Extra (from later sections):** Emerging trends like **containers, cloud, and redundancy** show how networking underpins *everything* from Netflix streams to self-driving car comms.
