# Internet Addressing (i'm in a rush honey so these notes are as barebones as... a skeleton?)

Internet Protocol: IP

IPv4 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

DNS server takes a domain name and converts it into numerical value. This value is the IP and lets you connect to a node on the network.

With IPv4 there are 4.3 billioin possible values.

You can have 256 possibilities per xxx

IPv6 is 128 bit and not 64 bit and is built for when IPv4 is filled up.

Can have a 2 way connection

## Sockets and ports

Each process gets a port/socket address. This lets processes communicate to each other specifically.

For example if you're on a skype call you don't need that call information going to any other process.

xxx:yyyy

At the end of the IP you include the port address to specify which process you wanna have a lovely chat with.
