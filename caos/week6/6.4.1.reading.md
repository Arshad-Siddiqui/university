# üå©Ô∏è Cloud Computing and Virtualisation

## Traditional In-House Infrastructure

* Historically, organisations owned and managed their own **servers** and IT equipment.
* **Drawbacks:**

  * **High upfront costs** (hardware, storage upgrades).
  * **Staffing needs** for maintenance and security.
  * **Backup requirements** (local + remote copies).
  * **Risk of failure** (server crash or fire can cause data loss).
  * **Location limitations** (harder to support remote teams).

## Cloud Computing

* Cloud = **leasing remote IT resources** instead of running them in-house.

* Services delivered over the internet by providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

* **Benefits:**

  * **Scalability** ‚Äì pay for what you use, scale up or down on demand.
  * **Flexibility** ‚Äì access from anywhere, support remote staff.
  * **Cost management** ‚Äì no upfront investment; spread over time.
  * **Reliability** ‚Äì built-in redundancy; failures handled seamlessly.
  * **Security** ‚Äì large providers maintain strong security infrastructure.

* **Types:**

  * **Cloud Storage** ‚Äì reliable remote data storage (backed up in multiple locations).
  * **Cloud Compute** ‚Äì remote processing power on demand.
  * **Hybrid** ‚Äì mix of both storage and compute.

## Compute Servers & Virtual Machines

* A **compute server** provides **processing power** remotely.

* Staff can run compute-intensive tasks without needing powerful local PCs.

* Example: Medical imaging analysis offloaded to cloud servers ‚Üí faster + more efficient.

* **Virtual Machine (VM):**

  * An emulated computer environment running on shared physical hardware.
  * Appears to each user as if they have their **own full system**.
  * Multiple VMs can coexist on one physical server.

---

## Virtualisation

* Technology that allows multiple **virtual machines** to share one physical computer.
* Managed by a **hypervisor**, which allocates resources and keeps VMs isolated.

### Types of Virtualisation

1. **Native (Bare-metal):**

   * Hypervisor runs **directly on hardware**.
   * Efficient and scalable; common in cloud providers.
2. **Hosted:**

   * Hypervisor runs **on top of an existing OS**.
   * Flexible, can run different OS types (Windows hosting Linux VM).
3. **Local:**

   * User runs VMs on their personal machine (e.g., Mac running Windows via Parallels or Linux via VirtualBox).
   * Useful for testing, software development, or legacy applications.

### Benefits

* **Resource efficiency** ‚Äì fewer physical servers needed.
* **Isolation** ‚Äì each VM behaves independently.
* **Flexibility** ‚Äì run multiple OS environments on one machine.
* **Scalability** ‚Äì easy to spin up/down additional VMs.

## üìù Key Terms

* **Cloud Computing** ‚Äì remote, scalable IT resource provision.
* **Virtual Machine (VM)** ‚Äì a simulated computer running on shared hardware.
* **Hypervisor** ‚Äì software layer managing VMs.
* **Native Virtualisation** ‚Äì hypervisor on bare hardware.
* **Hosted Virtualisation** ‚Äì hypervisor on top of an OS.
* **Local Virtualisation** ‚Äì running VMs on a personal machine.

## ‚ùì Task Questions

### 1. How do the benefits of cloud computing compare to traditional in-house IT?

* **Cloud computing** offers scalability, global access, resilience, and reduced upfront cost.
* **Traditional IT** requires heavy upfront investment, in-house staff, and risks downtime or data loss.
* **Trade-off:** Cloud = ongoing costs and reliance on provider. In-house = more control, but higher maintenance.

### 2. How does virtualisation enhance efficiency?

* Allows **many virtual systems** to run on **one physical server**, improving resource utilisation.
* Provides **isolation**, ensuring one VM‚Äôs crash doesn‚Äôt affect others.
* Reduces costs by eliminating the need for separate machines.
* Makes IT resources more **flexible and scalable**, especially for cloud services.

‚ú® **Summary:**
Cloud computing shifts IT from **owning hardware** to **renting scalable resources**. Virtualisation underpins this by letting one machine act like many. Together, they bring efficiency, flexibility, and reliability, shaping how organisations manage resources in the modern era.
