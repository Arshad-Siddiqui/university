# 🌐 IP Addresses and the Global Internet

## The Global IP Internet

* The **Internet** is the most successful implementation of an *internetwork* (a network of networks).
* Originated in **ARPANET (1969)** → expanded with **TCP/IP (1983)** → today’s global infrastructure.
* Built on the **TCP/IP protocol suite**:

  * **IP** (Internet Protocol): provides addressing + best-effort delivery of *datagrams* between hosts.
  * **UDP**: lightweight, unreliable, allows datagrams from process to process.
  * **TCP**: reliable, full-duplex, ordered, connection-based communication between processes.
* From a programmer’s perspective:

  1. Every host has a unique **IP address**.
  2. IP addresses are mapped to **domain names** (human-readable).
  3. Processes communicate using **connections** (socket pairs).

## 🔢 IP Addresses

* An **IP address** is a **32-bit unsigned integer** (IPv4).
* Stored in **network byte order (big-endian)** for consistency across platforms.
* Human-readable **dotted-decimal notation**:
  Example → `128.2.194.242` corresponds to `0x8002C2F2`.
* Conversion functions (C library):

  * `htonl` / `htons`: host → network order.
  * `ntohl` / `ntohs`: network → host order.
  * `inet_pton`: dotted-decimal → binary.
  * `inet_ntop`: binary → dotted-decimal.

### IPv4 vs IPv6

* **IPv4**: 32-bit addressing (\~4.3 billion possible addresses).
* **IPv6**: 128-bit addressing → virtually limitless addresses. Adoption has been slow; IPv4 still dominates.

## 🌍 Internet Domain Names (DNS)

* **Domain names** are human-friendly aliases for IP addresses.
  Example: `www.cmu.edu` → `128.2.210.175`.
* Structured hierarchically:

  * Root (`.`)
  * Top-level domains (TLDs): `.com`, `.edu`, `.gov`, `.org`.
  * Second-level: `cmu.edu`
  * Third-level: `cs.cmu.edu`
* **DNS (Domain Name System)** is a distributed global database mapping domain names ↔ IPs.
* A single IP can map to multiple names, and a single name can map to multiple IPs (load balancing).
* Special case: `localhost` always maps to **127.0.0.1** (loopback).

## 🔗 Internet Connections

* A **connection** = communication link between two processes.

  * Point-to-point.
  * Full duplex (bidirectional).
  * Reliable (with TCP).
* Identified by a **socket pair**:

  ```
  (client_ip:client_port, server_ip:server_port)
  ```

  Example: `(128.2.194.242:51213, 208.216.181.15:80)`
* **Ports**:

  * Client → uses an ephemeral (temporary) port assigned by the kernel.
  * Server → listens on a **well-known port** (e.g., 80 = HTTP, 25 = SMTP).

## ✨ Why This Matters

* **IP addressing** = ensures data finds the right host.
* **Domain names** = make it usable for humans.
* **Sockets and connections** = allow process-to-process communication reliably.

# 🔑 Q\&A

### Q1: How do IP addresses and domain names work together?

* **IP addresses** → efficient, numerical identifiers for machines.
* **Domain names** → human-friendly labels that DNS translates into IPs.
* Together, they allow both **machines** and **humans** to communicate effectively.

### Q2: Why must programmers understand IP addressing?

* Debugging → know if an issue is in DNS resolution vs IP routing.
* Writing network code → often requires direct IP manipulation.
* Scalability → understanding IPv4 limits, IPv6 migration, and how applications handle multiple IPs per name.

👉 These concepts are the **foundation of Internet communication**: IP addresses ensure delivery, DNS makes it usable, and sockets turn it into reliable connections for programs.
