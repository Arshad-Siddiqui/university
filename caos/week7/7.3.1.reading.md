# Resilience, Reliability, and Safety in System Design

## Data Resilience

* **Definition**: The ability of a system to continue functioning correctly even when errors occur at the bit, device, or system level.
* **Sources of Errors**:

  * Cosmic rays flipping memory bits (common in space, aircraft altitudes).
  * Electrical noise, hardware degradation, or harsh environments.
  * Everyday rare faults (but serious in financial or safety-critical contexts).
* **Techniques**:

  * **Parity checks**: Extra bit ensures even/odd number of 1s in data. Detects single-bit errors but not all multi-bit errors.
  * **Dual parity (horizontal + vertical)**: Detects more complex errors across rows and columns.
  * **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**: More robust method for detecting transmission/storage errors.
  * **ECC (Error-Correcting Code memory)**: Built into DRAM modules; can detect and correct single-bit errors automatically.

*Trade-off*: Error correction increases reliability but reduces usable bandwidth/storage (extra bits transmitted).

## Resilient Systems

* **Reliability**: Statistical measure of how long a component/system operates before failing (Mean Time Between Failures, MTBF).
* **Resilience**: Goes beyond reliability—system continues functioning even when faults occur (via redundancy or safe fallback).
* **Strategies**:

  * **Redundancy**: Duplicate critical components so one can fail without system collapse.
  * **RAID (disk arrays)**: Mirror/stripe disks so loss of one does not destroy data.
  * **Hot-swappable drives**: Allow replacement without shutting down system.
  * **Probability management**: Example: pairing redundant drives reduces likelihood of critical failure by orders of magnitude.
* *Key idea*: System failure probability ≠ component failure probability; redundancy shifts risk.

## UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) Systems

* **Function**: Provide temporary power during outages.
* **Consumer use**: A few minutes of backup; enough to save data and shut down safely.
* **Enterprise use**: Large, sophisticated UPS can keep critical servers running for hours while shutting down less critical systems.
* **Impact**: Prevents catastrophic failure due to power loss, especially for safety-critical or financial systems.

## Resilience and Safety

* **Safety-critical systems**: Environments where failure risks lives (e.g., medical, aerospace, self-driving cars).
* **Graceful degradation**: System reduces functionality but stays safe. Example: car reduces speed or pulls over when critical failure detected.
* **Triple modular redundancy (TMR)**: Three processors independently compute; majority vote decides correct result. Prevents a single faulty processor from causing disaster.
* **Safe modes**: Systems engineered to move to the safest possible state when unexpected errors occur.

*Example*: Self-driving car with TMR can keep lane control reliable even if one processor fails.

## Key Terminology

* **Resilience**: System adapts and continues working through failures.
* **Reliability**: Likelihood system performs without failure for a period of time.
* **MTBF**: Mean Time Between Failures—average expected operational lifespan.
* **Graceful degradation**: Safe fallback behaviour under failure.
* **Redundancy**: Duplication of components/resources for fault tolerance.
* **UPS**: Backup power ensuring continuity during outages.

## Reflection Questions

**Q1: How does resilience differ from reliability?**

* *Reliability* is about how often components fail.
* *Resilience* is about how the system as a whole continues working even when parts fail.
* Importance: In critical systems (e.g., healthcare, aviation), it’s not enough to just have “reliable” parts—systems must be designed to survive and recover from inevitable failures.

**Q2: How do UPS systems contribute to safety and resilience?**

* Provide short-term backup power to allow safe shutdown or continuation of critical services.
* Prevent sudden data corruption or unsafe states in systems like hospitals, air-traffic control, or data centres.
* Broader impact: Ensures continuity of service and prevents harm caused by abrupt power loss.

✨ **Takeaway**: Modern systems are never 100% fault-free. Designing for resilience (with redundancy, UPS, error correction, and graceful degradation) transforms unavoidable failures into manageable events, ensuring both safety and service continuity.
