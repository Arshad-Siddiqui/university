# üõ°Ô∏è Computer Security Essentials: From Viruses to Encryption

## 14.1 Foreword

* Security is **central to OS responsibility**: protecting data, ensuring system integrity, and reducing risks.
* Threats come from both **malicious intent** (hackers, malware) and **accidental events** (faulty hardware, misconfiguration).
* OS security = proactive protection + mitigation strategies.

---

## 14.2 Security Threats

* A system is vulnerable when exposed to **unsafe entities** (networks, USB drives, removable media).
* **Types of threats**:

  * Data theft (stealing sensitive files).
  * Identity theft (stealing credentials).
  * Data corruption.
  * Denial of access (to files/services).
  * Misuse of resources (e.g., botnets).
  * Impersonation or spoofing.
* Even a small loophole ‚Üí potentially catastrophic exploit.

## 14.3 Viruses

* **Definition**: Programs designed to alter or damage system behavior. Require execution to activate.
* Spread by:

  * User running malicious programs.
  * Exploiting flaws in browsers or apps.
  * Boot-sector viruses (infect bootable drives).
* **Mitigation**:

  * Restrict boot options in BIOS.
  * Careful network & software usage.

### Virus Checkers (Anti-Virus Software)

* Scan data entering the system, matching against known **signatures**.
* Optimised to avoid full byte-by-byte checks.
* Weakness: New/polymorphic viruses mutate faster than signatures can update.

### Examples of Famous Viruses

* **CryptoLocker**: Ransomware encrypting files until ransom paid.
* **ILOVEYOU**: Spread via email, overwrote OS files.
* **MyDoom**: Turned systems into spam bots, DoS attacks.
* **Storm Worm**: Spread via email with shocking headlines, created zombie networks.
* **Sasser**: Exploited OS flaws, spread automatically.
* **Stuxnet**: Targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges via infected flash drives ‚Äì nation-state-level attack.

## 14.4 Architectural Exploits

* Unlike viruses, these exploit **hardware/system design weaknesses**.
* Known as **side-channel attacks**: attackers infer private info by observing system behavior (timing, cache, speculation).

### Examples:

* **TLBleed**: Exploited virtual memory‚Äôs TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer).
* **Spectre**: Manipulated speculative execution + branch prediction ‚Üí leaks private process data.
* **DMA Attack**: Malicious device uses Direct Memory Access to bypass OS protections.
* **Hyperthreading risks**: Shared core resources can leak info across threads.

‚û°Ô∏è These are **harder to fix** than software bugs because they exploit fundamental hardware features.

---

## 14.5 Firewalls

* **Definition**: Filters that block/allow traffic based on rules (IP, port, protocol).
* Can be **hardware (router)** or **software (OS firewall)**.
* Prevents **unauthorised access**, **data theft**, and **malicious traffic**.
* **Limitation**: Can‚Äôt stop all attacks (e.g., DoS floods using changing IPs).

---

## 14.6 Encryption & Validation

* **Encryption**: Protects data in transit/storage by making it unreadable without a key.
* **Validation**: Confirms data integrity and authenticity (e.g., digital signatures).

### Standards:

* **AES** (Advanced Encryption Standard) ‚Üí widely used.
* **RSA** ‚Üí public/private key encryption.
* **DES / 3DES** ‚Üí older, weaker standards.
* **SHA** (Secure Hash Algorithm) ‚Üí used for validation, not encryption.

### Notes:

* Stronger encryption (e.g., 256-bit) = harder to crack but requires **more CPU power**.
* Modern CPUs include **encryption accelerators** (faster but can also help attackers).
* **Quantum cryptography** = future possibility, not yet practical.

# ‚ú® Big Picture

* **Viruses vs. Architectural Exploits**:

  * Viruses = software-based, rely on execution and tricking users.
  * Exploits = hardware/system weaknesses, harder to patch, often require disabling features.

* **Layered Security Approach**:

  * **Firewalls** ‚Üí block unwanted traffic.
  * **Antivirus** ‚Üí catch malicious code.
  * **Encryption** ‚Üí protect data even if intercepted.
  * **Validation** ‚Üí guarantee integrity.

* **Real-World Impact**:

  * Malware like ransomware can cripple businesses.
  * Exploits like Spectre forced CPU vendors to redesign architectures.
  * Security = continuous arms race between attackers and defenders.

‚úÖ **Answers to your guiding questions:**

**Q1. How do architectural exploits differ from software-based threats like viruses?**

* Viruses = external code that needs to run. Easier to block (firewalls, AV).
* Exploits = flaws in CPU/memory design. Much harder to fix ‚Üí may require hardware redesign. Bigger long-term challenge.

**Q2. How do encryption and validation complement firewalls and virus scanners?**

* Firewalls/antivirus = prevention + detection.
* Encryption/validation = last line of defense ‚Üí protect confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity even if perimeter defenses fail.
